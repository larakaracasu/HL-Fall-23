ernment forces be disarmed before any coalition agreement) brought the situation to a crisis point. The crisis was resolved by a combination of Western pressure and the government's refusal to accept a coalition government without prior disarmament of the Pathet Lao. 4. The Royal Lao Government is in a precarious position. Its leaders are divided among themselves and have little popular support. The Royal Lao Army, though numerically strong, is poorly trained, badly led, and lacks morale. Its effectiveness is further weakened by the presence of large numbers of Pathet Lao troops in the North. The government is dependent on foreign assistance, and its ability to resist Comunist pressure is limited. 5. The Communist position in Laos is strong. The Pathet Lao are numerically superior to the Royal Lao Army in the North, and have been able to maintain their privileged sanctuary. The Communists have been able to exploit the government's weaknesses to secure a series of concessions, and have been able to maintain a unified front in the negotiations. 6. In the short run, the most likely outcome of the present situation is a negotiated settlement involving a coalition government, integration of Pathet Lao troops into the Royal Lao Army, and the legalization of Communist political activity. Such a settlement would be accompanied by a further elaboration of Lao neutrality policy in the direction of eventual relations with the Communist bloc.
