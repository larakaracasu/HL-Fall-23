AT DECEMBER 5 NSC ITNR CCIKE FOR POLAD' CA TSHOMBE'S FUTURE AND PLANS: ACTION INITIATED BY TSHOMBE AND FOUND A ADOQUATE SUPPORT IN MANY ELEMENTS OF THE BELGIAN COMMUNITY, THAT TSHOMBE BE NAMED VICE-PRESIDENT (AS DISTINCT FROM VICE-PREMIER), HAS BACKFIRED BADLY AND THE CURRENT MOOD OF MOBUTU AND SOMBOKO IS VERY ANTI-TSHOMBE. DURING THE LAST FOUR TO FIVE DAYS, PRO-TSHOMBE NEEDLING HAS ANNOYED THAT GROUP AND HAS THUS PERMITTED ANTI-TSHOMBE ELEMENTS, OF WHICH THERE ARE OF COURSE STILL MANY, TO PAGE TWO RUQS 101 Q_W R M ORT 2. NO 04.E KNOWS PRECISELY WHAT TSHOMBE'S INTENTIONS ARE BUT THERE IS MUCH TALK, PROBABLY BASED ON A GOOD DEAL OF SUBSTANCE, THAT HE IS CONSIDERING TAKING REFUGE IN EUROPE. THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR AND ALL BETTER INFORMED ELEMENTS HERE ARE VIOLENTLY OPPOSED TO SUCH A PLAN AND BELIEVE THAT TSHOMBE'S JOB, PRESENTLY, IS TO REMAIN AS LOYAL AS POSSIBLE TO THE PRESENT REGIME. 3. ALTHOUGH I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TOMORROW WITH SOMBOKO, I INTEND TO REFRAIN FROM DISCUSSING INTERNAL POLITICS IN PARTICULAR, MAKING ANY SUGGESTIONS REGARDING TSHOMBE'S FUTURE. I WILL, HOWEVER, SPEAK OF MODERATION ON ALL MATTERS. A. RIA-THAGOUPAN ASUPEMITE AT STIB CUE? 21088, December 5 from: Leopoldville. I HAVE NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO SEE TSHOMBE BUT IF I DO I WILL POINT OUT THAT IT IS EXTREMELY UNWISE FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE CONGO, THAT IT WILL GIVE HIS ENEMIES A FIELD DAY, AND HE WILL BE CUT OFF FROM ANY SAY IN CONGOLESE MATTERS. I WILL POINT OUT WHAT ABSENCE FROM THE CONGO DID FOR ADOULA, AND WILL STRONGLY URGE THAT HE REMAIN HERE. LOCAL PETROCONGO REP, A BELGIAN WHO HAS READY ACCESS TO TSHOMBE, IS TAKING A SIMILAR LINE AND IS DEPARTING TOMORROW FOR GOMA WHERE HE WILL DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH VAN WYENBERG. ENLISTING UMHKS SUPPORT? BELIEVE THIS IS ALL THAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR THE TIME BEING, AS ALL CONGOLESE APPEAR DISGRUNTLED WITH FOREIGN ADVICE.
