Memorandum for: Mr. Martin Dowd, ERDA Division of Safeguards & Security Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Attn: Intelligence Division 

From: William W. Wells, Deputy Director of Operations 

Subject: Alleged Offer for Sale of Uranium and Plutonium 

Reference: CIA/DDO memorandum dated 4 February 1977, same subject 

1. In addition to the report in reference, we have been advised by the source of that information that the composition of the uranium offered for sale by IBGHI is 99.3% of U-238, 0.7% of U-235, and 0.006% of U-234, i.e. natural uranium. The source further reported that the uranium was located in Switzerland, but that four bars of 10 kg each have now been transported to Paris along with 120 kg of cobalt. According to the source, IBGHI showed the source two laboratory certificates, one of which was from Lisbon, which guaranteed the genuineness of the uranium and cobalt. 

2. Although the source could not report the first name of IBGHI, he described him as an Israeli in his early thirties, about six feet tall, slim, and dark-haired. 

3. In view of the unreliability of the source of this information, it is unlikely that additional information of value can be obtained from him. However, should such information come to our attention, it will be forwarded to the addressees.
