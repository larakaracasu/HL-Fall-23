FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Two RB-57E Twin-Jet Reconnaissance Aircraft, Equipped To Take Day, Night and Infrared Photographs, Have Arrived in Southeast Asia, Making Four RB-57Es Now There
The first two have infrared (IR) sensors for photos which must be developed and processed by photo interpreters before the intelligence can be used. The two most recent arrivals have the sensors plus a cockpit display or "read-out" which alerts the crew to suspicious ground activity. The "read-out" permits a second or third pass over an area to obtain confirmation or more detail. The RB-57 crew can then alert friendly attack forces by radio immediately.

Primary IR reconnaissance objective is to locate fleeting targets, such as vehicles, troops and watercraft, for quick reaction attacks; but equipment is new and effective employment tactics are still being developed. Also, not all IR emissions (positive signals of ground activity) result in attacks for several reasons. The target area may be too close to friendly personnel. There may be reasonable doubt as to whether the target is hostile or friendly. The emission may be too fleeting to permit a reaction.
