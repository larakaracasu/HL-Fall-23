~~ of new techniques of attack. The diversion of ICBM forces could have an important effect on the military balance.

A. Although the potential capabilities of sophisticated ICBMs are undisputed, they must be balanced against the expectation that the Soviets will make some errors in the design of their ICBM force and have technical, organizational, and resource difficulties which could limit the capabilities of this force. Our own experience with the development and deployment of ICBM forces has provided examples of such limitations. 
B. The existence of a deployed defense may substantially increase the degree of uncertainty at the Soviet decision-making level. The offense will find it very difficult to be certain that weaknesses do not exist which may have been discovered by the defense. Recent evidence indicates that existing warheads on our ballistic missiles are subject to destruction at fairly large distances by nuclear detonations. Although this would not in fact make NIKE ZEUS effective against planned U.S. missile systems, it is an example of the unpredictable elements involved. 
C. In Soviet planning for a military operation, there would have to be some diversion of ICBM forces to penetrate a deployed defense, even though the economic exchange ratio is unfavorable to the defense. This may take the form of extra missiles assigned to saturate, confuse, or destroy anti-missile systems or the introduction of new techniques of attack. The diversion of ICBM forces could have an important effect on the military balance.
