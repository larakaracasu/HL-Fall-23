Philippines, Visit of His Excellency Elpidio Quirino, President of the [listing of officials Thesis That Soviet Internal Weaknesses Constitute the Determining Factor in Current Soviet Foreign Policy [the USSR faces the strains of any govt. which "rules by repression," has not provided a satisfactory standard of living, and has rapidly acquired control over foreign and hostile govts., but there have been no recent developments which have produced weakness sufficient to force the govt. to seek international settlements or relief from immediate pressures; stability of the Communist Party and govt. apparatus, loyalty of the armed forces, morale of the people, possibility of opposition groups, economy, industry, transportation, agriculture, trade, military strength, foreign policy and prestige, economic and political situation in satellites, and China as a potential satellite are analyzed].

TOP SECRET RETYPED COPY 16. pursuit of the Germany army and SoXiet citizens were liberated from labor service and prisoner-of-war camps in Western and Eastern Europe, political reindoctrination began. It was effected by means of litera- ture, lectures, radio, and movies, both in assembly points for dis- placed Soviet citizens and enroute to and upon arrival in the Soviet Union. Less reliable elements were reportedly detained for varying periods of screening before they were permitted to return to their homes or were resettled. Ex-Soviet citizens have expressed their belief that the Soviet Government retained a large number of returning servicemen under arms in order to control them in spite of the need for manpower in industry and agriculture. To cope with the problem of repatriates, an Administration for Repatriation Affairs was created by the Soviet Government with a repre- sentative in the Council of Ministers. In addition to handling the physical problems of repatriation, the Administration was responsible for political reindoctrination at assembly points in Europe and in transit to the USSR. .b. Soviet leaders appear to be satisfied that the special efforts to nullify contamination resulting from wartime contacts have been successful. Propaganda against ideas and experiences of veterans and repatriated citizens has lost its special character, be- coming part of the general propaganda line directed against "capitalist" society. 3. Desertions from the Soviet armed forces to Western occu- pation zones have not been on a sufficiently large scale to serve as evidence of the existence-of serious popular opposition to the Com- munist regime. a. Despite common reports to the effect that mass flights of Soviet military personnel have occurred since the end of hos- tilities, US military authorities in Germany estimate that the total number of Soviet deserters who arrived in the US Zone during the three years between September 1945 and December 1948 amounted to 3,000. Of this estimate, only a fraction has actually been verified. Thus, in October 1948, US Army authorities reported that from mid-1945 through September 1948 apprehended deserters totaled 205 for the British and American Zones of Germany combined, and 165 for the British and Ameri- can Zones of Austria combined. Of the deserters interrogated, most explained their flight on the basis of personal rather than "morale" considerations; the principal single reason given was the desire to continue relations with German or Austrian women. TOP SECRET
RETYPED Copy TOP SECRET 17. 4. No organized opposition groups, open or underground, capa- ble of threatening the stability of, or seriously embarrassing, the Soviet regime are known to exist in the USSR, although national minorities will continue to constitute a potential threat. a. A potential source of active opposition to the Kremlin lies in the many Soviet minorities that have been at various times in the past forcibly inco,-oorated into Moscow's domain. Individualistic and nationalistic feeling among these peoples persists today, although there is no indication that it has recently become more intense. The Soviet Union embraces some 180 different nationality groups speaking 125 different languages and traditionally professing 40 different religions. Approximately 42 percent of the population is non-Russian. Opposition of many of the non-Russian elements to the Kremlin's control extends far back into the Tsarist period. The policy followed by the new Moscow rulers in their efforts todiminish the hos- tility of monority peoples, which the Tsars succeeded in living with but not overcoming, has been to allow them the trappings and form of local autonomy, while vigorously withholding any vestige of real power, and to permit and even encourage the use of native languages and customs. Since ideas have to be consonant with current Communist doctrines, the slogan to rationalize the situation is: cultures shall be "nationalist in form and socialist in content." That the Cummunist effort to engender support among the minorities has not been entirely successful was clearly demonstrated in the wartime defections of whole peoples. During and since the war the national administrative units of seven Soviet monority peoples totaling more than 1.25 million persons were either abolished or re- organized to exclude the monorities. Most of them were charged with having been unreliable during the war and having collaborated with the enemy. As retribution they were forcibly resettled in other parts of the Soviet Union. The defections of these peoples probably did not embarrass the Kremlin as much as the instances of unreliability that occurred during the war among the Ukrainians -- the largest Soviet national group after the Great Russians, currently estimated by Soviet authori- ties to number more than 37 million people or almost 19 percent of the total population. When the Red Army began moving westward after the German defeat at Stalingrad, sufficient armed opposition developed among the Ukrainians to gain the attention of the topmost Party leaders. In March 1944, N. S. Khrushchev, Politburo member and Party wartime leader in the Ukraine, offered the various Ukrainian anti-Soviet parti- san bands amnesty and forgiveness if they would lay down their arms and TOP SECRET
RETYPED COPY TOP SECRET 18. return to peaceful ways. This admission of opposition among the Ukrainians to the Soviet reconquest of their homeland lends credence to reports that when the Wehrmacht began its invasion of the USSR the peasantry of many Ukrainian villages met the German soldiers with the traditional bread and salt of welcome. Organized armed opposition among the Ukrainians to the reestablishment of the Soviet order after the war was indirectly admitted in the Moscow press as late as August 1947 and may have existed up to January 1948. It is likely that after the latter date most organized resistance among the Ukrainians was destroyed and on'v the bitter diehards remained to carry on terrorist activities. One act of terrorist activities which was attributed in the Soviet press to the "Ukrainian bourgeois--nationalist underground" was the murder of Moscow-oriented Archpriest Gavriil Kostelnik in Lvov in September 1948. b. In the postwar period the Kremlin has placed special emphasis on combatting any separatist tendencies in the thinking of minority peoples. Intellectuals of the minority peoples were criticized as early as May 1945 for presenting views in their publications that would allegedly encourage separatists (sic) sentiments. In the summer of 1946 Communist party watchdogs began to "purge" the writings of non-Russian intellectuals of "bourgeois-nationalist," anti-Soviet, and anti-Russian ideas. This compaign (sic), which encom- passed the intellectuals in Central Asia as well as those in the Caucasus and the western border areas of the USSR, is still being pressed vigorously among the central Asiatics numbering more than 12 million people and indicates the continued sensitivity and alert- ness of the Communist leadership to the potential seriousness of the minorities problem. c. The Kremlin has been particularly careful in hand- 'ling the Baltic countries for fear that the immediate introduction of the entire Soviet system would arouse serious opposition. The most important concession which Moscow made to the continuation of the old order in the Baltic countries was to permit individual exploitation of the land on plots limited to maximum of 30 hectares (65 acres). (In the USSR proper private farms were limited in May 1939 to 1.2 hectares and in fact rarely exceeded one-half hectare.) That by the beginning of 1949 the Communist leadership of the USSR felt its grip on the Baltic states to be virtually complete was indicated when at that time it began rapidly to accelerate the land collectivization drive in those areas. By May 1949, 80 percent of the individual TOP SECRET
RETYPED COPY TOP SECRET 19. peasant households in Latvia were collectivized, 65 percent in Estonia, and probably about 50 percent in Lithuania. Collectivization has been less rapid in Lithuania, reflecting a greater amount of opposi- tion there to the Soviet system. As recently as December 1948 a local Lithuanian Party newspaper revealed that "bourgeois-nationalist bands" were trying to impede collectivization. d. Despite the fact that Soviet authorities appear to have the nationalities problem well in hand for the time being, it remains an important potential weakness of the Bolshevik regime. If the firm hold of the central authority in Moscow were broken, or seriously threatened, many of the non-Russian peoples of the USSR would probably seize the opportunity to attempt to achieve independence as they did immediately after World War I.

Continuance of the payohologi- .. cal atm.osphore that has boon gradually built up in Wostern Europo . depends in large measure on future Amerioan ratification of the North Atlantio Treaty, inplemontation of the projected Military Assistance Prog.ca, and continued under-sriting of ER2. i.t, , The Sov'ot position on major East-West isueas in Surope, outside of the orbit, appoars at the present time as followas ao Gerar. The USSR has failed thus far to imp'qdc the political unification and the economio rohabilitation of Western Germany, to participate in the control of the Ruhr, to obtain fulfill- . i m5nt of its reparation demands, or to dislodge the Western powors '- from Berlin. Th3 Communist Party in Western Germany. which mas sup- ."-. [- :.ported by loss than 10 percent of the voting population in the 194G elictions, appears subsequontly to have declined in strength as in- dioated by decreasing Com unist reprosentation in the works councils. In Sautorn Germany the USJR has tiChteniod its control by eliminatin6g dissident non-Co,m.unists, and even Communists, from ad- ministrat've and paArty positions. Although Communist domination of the political, economic, and social life of the Soviet Zono is " nou virtually complete, the Coaunist-dominatod Socialist Unity Party (S*D) has stcadily lost popular support. This was tacitly acknowlodred by the Soviet postponement of local elections originally scheduled for the fall of 19A8, the published results of the May 1949 election for the People's Congress, and the rocont SED espousal of a "national Jfront." On the economic aid, the USSR despite earlier dis.antlin s . appears to have been obtaining a. fairly constant amount of reparations and requisitions from current industrial production (estimated at about 25 percent of total production for 1948). Until the currency reform in Western Germany (June 1948), it had succeeded in fostering economio rooovery in its zone at approximately the same rate as in .estern Germany. Since then, however, while the rate of recovery continued to rise sharply in Western Germany, it remained static in TOP SI,CRET e;l ' * . *
