Rumanian-American Relations [regarding CEMA, the Rumanians noted nothing can be done by CEMA without unanimous approval of members. Harriman noted that recent signs of Rumanian independence of Moscow met with an approving reaction among Americans, and it might be possible for the US to be more receptive to Rumanian trade requests. The Rumanians spoke at length of the importance not only of increased trade but of signs of response to requests to purchase industrial installations]. Memorandum of Conversation [W.

Trade ond Industrial Inst3llatlons. -9spoke at Eome -eD6 a thls pOi,t,-nh sizing the importance which ths -Rumsnian Government attaches not only to increased trade with the United States but to "sone siL-ns" of response on our part to their raque_ts to purch-se industrial installations. They en:phosized that Mr. GheorLhiu-Dej had __de clear to Secretary Frae?z&n that this was their basic concern and had several tires requested Secretaxy Fraonen to convey to President Kennedy the Rumanian desire for sone positive ection in tbib sense, and particulerly with rerard to two synthetic rubber plants, one a polybutadlene and the other on isoprene Installation. Both of these h3d baen included in the $100 million shopping list Minister Balaceau had presented the United States Government in the spring of 1962, and it was still hoped that they could be provided. Tney would only be intended for w,holly peaceful uses, and if licenses could be granted the Rum9nian people w:ould feel Lreatly encourared. ' j observed that more than half of the 10 Installations on their oriZinal shopping list for which licenses were not forthcom-ing last year were meanwhile contracted for by West O, European firns, end he cited as one example a tire factory supplied by the U. " " .. .also expressed the Rimanion desire to incronse exports to the US t1-ough assistonce o 1-N if possible. If this were not possible, hoped that some favorable tcriff orranements EiGht be made roi a limited nunber of products they would particularly lke to export to the US. Governor Harriman repeated that the Iuztnian 2how of indepondence toward Vaosoow created a better atinosphere for considering ir proved econ- COMic relations and that Mr. Gheorghiu-Dej's proposals would be carefully _tudled. He warned that action on such matters may take tire but assured 3dthat he would look further into the entire question. As for Ohe dosir5d Industrial Installations, there were really two aspects of the subject, those of licensing and financing. linister Crawford 'f,plainad so=e sspe'cts of the Rumanian financing procedures in comparable dols with Western European firms which have sold Riucania soze $350-$400 million worth of industrial installations over the past three years. jmade the personal suggestion that a US-Rumanian joint study Lroup on trade expansion mICht be usefully set up at this juncture. Gvornor Harriran expressed interest In the idea but was noncommittal. $said that he pl&nned to extend his stay here by several days endl would like to have 1.finister Crawford and Mr. Vedeler for a stag dinoer on August ]2 to pursue matters further.
