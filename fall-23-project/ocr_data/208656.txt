[Vietnam and Vietnam War] Evolution of Communist Positions concerning Negotiations [North Vietnam has traditionally discussed terms for settlement rather than for negotiations and has been firm on insistence of US withdrawal of troops, observance of the 1954 Geneva Accords, and settlement of differences by the South Vietnamese and the Liberation Front with the Liberation Front playing a decisive role. The People's Republic of China has been adamant against negotiations and has attacked the USSR for promoting talks. The USSR has taken a noncommittal stand on negotiations since the first US bombing strikes on North Vietnam and has unofficially stated that no negotiations can take place until US air strikes end].

Since the intensification of the war in V tnan early in February, all the communist regimes Involvod have pro reossively hardened their positions on n..otiati.cns.

T1eir position, which calls for the withdrawal of US trooIs, cessation of US "aggression, and refusal to even hint at the possibility of nec-otiations on -:y but Communist terms, has not been altered by the charge in the pattern of the war. The Chinese have 2;ed that US bombizits must cease, and h.ave supported ;-.~aoi and the Front on the need for the Front to take :-'t in negotiations. 3. i.Mrdiately after the first US bo_:-bing at- cs, the Soviet Union appear..d willing to try to ararr'.,a nrgotiations._ _ of s-r.me sort on Southea.st As-ian 7. , - , - I.'
