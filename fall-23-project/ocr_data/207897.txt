(S) Air Rescue Service (ARS) helicopters made 2 rescues under enemy ground fire, and ARS amphibious planes saved 3 men in 2 ocean pick-ups made under shell fire from the North Vietnam shore. Chrono- logically, the highlights were as follows: (C) On 17 September, a Vietnamese aircraft carrying 5 persons crashed about 25 miles north of Saigon; one survived, but with severe burns. An ARS HH-43 helicopter piloted by Captain Darwan E. Cook (Hdisington, Kansas) was scrambled and made the recovery despite enemy ground fire. (S) Four days later an F-105 pilot was downed over extremely rough terrain just over the Laotian border from Thailand. A CH-3C flown by Captain George C. Martin (Chicago) went to the scene and located the pilot on a small ledge 500 feet down the side of a precipice. Notwithstanding rock walls on 3 sides plus enemy ground fire, Captain Martin hovered his ARS "chopper" within 10 feet of the ledge and a tree penetrator (a device with spring-loaded arms normally used to penetrate heavy foliage) was used to make the rescue. The CH-3C received several hits but the survivor was returned to base with only minor injuries. (S) On 22 September, the pilot of a Vietnamese attack aircraft bailed out over the Gulf of Tonkin after his plane received major battle damage. Flying an HU-16, USAF Captain David K. Richardson (Pittsford, N. Y.) located the pilot 2 miles off the shore of North Vietnam. An open sea landing was made, the rescue followed, and 12 heavy artillery shells exploded in the wake of the HU-16 as it took off. Four Navy fighter aircraft provided a "rescue combat air patrol" over the operation. (S) Shore fire zeroed in to within 10 yards of another HU-16 during a 17-minute rescue operation on 24 September. The ARS amphibian picked up the Z-man crew of an Air Force F-4C which had sustained major damage and crashed in the ocean off North Vietnam. The HU-16 was piloted by Major Donald C. Hollfelder (Naha Air Base, Okinawa). (C) From December 1964-September 1965, ARS has saved 5Z airmen: 34 USAF, 11 U.S. Navy, 4 U.S. Army, and 3 Vietnamese Air Force.

(U) Self-Recovery System To Enable the M-113 Armored Personnel Carriers To Negotiate Steep Banks Are Being Sent to Republic of Vietnam. (U) System, developed by U. S. Army Limited War Laboratory, consists of two 300 foot lengths of one inch nylon rope, 2 capstans with mounting hardware, and Z Danforth type anchors. This system provides an improved means for assisting the M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier to exit from water obstacles, such as streams, rivers and canals with steep banks frequently encountered in military operations, especially in the Delta area of Vietnam. When used in the vehicle assist role, the anchor can provide 15, 000 pounds of holding force. (U) Two men, with minimum training, can emplace the anchor and activate the system in less than 5 minutes. Tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, indicate that canal crossing time can be reduced 80 to 90% by using the self-recovery system. (U) General Westmoreland requested an operational quantity of 111 systems for M-113s in support of Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces in the Delta area. Thirty systems are scheduled for delivery to Vietnam in November 1965; 40 in December 1965; and 41 systems in January 1966. DoD 26 Oct 1965 COL y LB$ LIJRAR y

(C) Army shipped 40 MITY MITES to Vietnam on 18 September 1965 for use as tunnel flushing devices. The MITY MITE, which is a commercial-type, man-portable crop duster, manufactured by the Buffalo Turbine Equipment Co., forces smoke and similar gaseous materials into tunnel and cave openings, thus forcing unmasked occu- pants to evacuate. In addition, exiting of the smoke from tunnel and cave openings permits soldiers to find and guard alternate exits and prevent escape by the occupants. (U) MITY MITE, which weighs 22 pounds, supplies 450 cubic feet of air per minute for 2 hours on 1 gallon of gasoline. No particular skill is required to operate it.

(U) Air Force Is Maintaining Operational Readiness ToSupport the Resumption of Atmospheric Nuclear Testing, Should Such Testing Ever Be Resumed. (U) Air Force readiness to support atmospheric testing was demonstrated recently during Operation WHIPCORD BRAVO, a joint Defense -AEC exercise conducted by the Commander, Joint Task Force EIGHT. The drop area for this exercise was about 400 miles off the coast of California. The operation, the second of a series of U.S. based readiness exercises, also proved the operational feasibility of a target- less array drop concept. This concept uses a countdown for the air drop of a weapon rather than a target at a fixed point. This will give greater flexibility in selecting areas with suitable weather for nuclear te s ting.

(U) Army Engineers Troop Housing Construction Program Is Replacing Obsolete World War I Barracks. (U) The barracks complex program, being carried out by Army Corps of Engineers, has totaled about $214 million since its initiation in FY 1964. It includes modern barracks, training, recreation and other support facilities in all 6 U.S. Army areas. More than 2, 000 over -aged World War II structures will eventually be replaced by these new barracks complexes. (U) This program is part of Army's continuing effort to replace World War II temporary facilities with permanent -type structures. In addition to these barracks complexes, Corps of Engineers is building numerous other smaller troop housing projects at Army installations in both U.S. and over- seas. These smaller projects provide only one or two barracks buildings and a minimum of support facilities and are not large enough to be classified as barracks complexes. (U) A typical barracks complex, of permanent fire-resistant con- struction, consists of ten 326 -man barracks; 4 battalion mess buildings; 4 administration and storage buildings; 4 battalion headquarters and class - room buildings; a regimental headquarters building; a chapel; a gymnasium; a dispensary; and a post exchange. (U) In FY 1964, the program amounted to $43 million and provided new facilities for 9,780 men at 4 Army installations. The FY 1964 program is rapidly nearing completion. (U) The FY 1965 program totaled over $90 million, and is now more than one-third completed. It provides barracks and support facilities for 24, 360 men at 9 Army posts in U.S. (U) The FY 1966 military construction bill, recently signed into law, provides $81 million in new barracks and support ICLiti1 for- 20, 212 men at 8 Army installations.

This laboratory effort is at NASA's request, and is an extension of work previously conducted to assist in an atmosphere selection for spacecraft. (U) The Laboratory will have a working agreement with a local hospital to permit studies on volunteer subjects having respiratory infections. Subjects for these studies will be limited to males who demonstrate an upper or lower respiratory infection. Both types will be investigated. A control group of subjects will also be monitored in an attempt to differentiate between the pattern produced by the normal progress of the infection and that occasioned by the use of 100% oxygen environment as now used in spacecraft and some military aircraft. (U) Phase I of the investigation will be conducted at sea level in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen at the participating hospital. Phase 1 will be prosecuted in the Altitude Facility at the Navy Aerospace Crew Equipment Laboratory at which the oxygen exposure will be at a simulated altitude of 27, 000 feet (5 PSIA). (U) ClinicA:l and physiological measurements will include but not be limited to: arte'rial blood gas analysis; alveolar - arterial oxygen gradients; pulmonary function tests; chest and sinus X-rays; and complete ear, nose, and throat studies.

(U) Naval Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia, Is Cooperating With the Southeastern Tidewater Opportunity Program for Rehabilitation of School Drop-Outs. (U) The Naval Supply Center has offered to provide a minimum of 40 positions for youths aged 16 to 24 selected by Southeastern Tidewater Opportunity Program officials. The positions pay $1. 25 an hour for a 32- hour work week. Navy supervisors on each job will adjust the hours so that they will not interfere with school work. (U) Although the assignments will exclude hazardous working conditions or environment, Navy will be able to complete work which otherwise could not be accomplished this year. (U) The Tidewater Branch, organized under the Neighborhood Youth Opportunity Program sponsored by the Office of Economic Opportunity, hopes eventually to place 1, 000 youths in positions in the area.

co'i#ItDENTIAL ' DECLASSIFIED .;tort, y E. 0. 11R5 OS .. 5(A) and D) 7l., ,NARS, Date..: (C) About 8, 000 Foreign Military from 54 Countries Receive Formal Training under the Military Assistance Program at U. S. Service Schools. (C) Training is conducted at Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps installations. Relatively senior foreign officers attend the Com- mand and General Staff College, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas; the Air Force Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama; and the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Intermediate level training is conducted at such installations as Ft. Benning, Georgia for infantry officers; at Quantico, Virginia for Marines; at Maxwell AFB, Alabama for squadron officers; and at various Naval installations. In addition to higher level command and staff training, foreign students participate extensively in courses in general military management, pilot training, civic action, counterinsurgency, and aviation and communications maintenance of all .types, as well as a wide range of naval technical courses. In all, this training is conducted at some 90 U. S. installations. (C) The primary purpose of the training is to develop proficiency of friendly and allied forces in the military and other skills listed above. Of significant importance, however, are the collateral benefits from the close association between U.S. personnel and these foreign nationals. To enhance the collateral benefits of U. S. training, Defense has been conducting an Informational Program for Foreign Military Trainees at military training centers. The program, extra-curricular to the courses of military instruction, is designed to give the foreign student knowledge about the U. S., its people, its streng h, and its goals. By exposure to American traditions, institutions, and ideals, the foreign student obtains a better understanding of the U.S. and the basis for its stability as a leader in the free world.
