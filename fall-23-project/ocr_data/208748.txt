Military Situation and Requirements in South Vietnam [it is the consensus [five alternative military courses of action are examined according to their ability to counter the enemy offensive and destroy or neutralize the NVA invasion force in the north, to restore security in the cities and towns, to restore security in the heavily-populated area of the countryside, and to regain the initiative through offensive operations. The analysis of each option assumes the deferral of the civilianization program, which authorized a strength level of 537,500. Option 1 calls for an additional 196,000 troops and relaxation of restrictions on operations in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam; option 1A includes the deployment of 196,000 additional troops but maintains restrictions on operations in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam; options 2-4 call for deployments of 10,700-100,000 more troops. It is recommended that immediate actions be taken to implement option 1, specifically: extension of authority to order to active duty units and individuals of the Ready Reserve for a period not to exceed 24 months; authority to extend enlistments, appointments, and periods of active duty; selective industrial mobilization; procurement acceleration; removal of restraints on military operations in Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam].

R - SENSITIVE SECTION T - PURPOSE A. The Problem. To provide military advice on the military 1 implications of several courses of action to defeat the enemy 2 offensive and to regain the initiative in Vietnam. 3 B. Study Objectives. The study examines five alternative 4 military courses of action. Each is examined as to its ability 5 to attain the following military objectives: 6 1. First, to counter the enemy offensive and to destroy or 7 neutralize the North Vietnamese Army (1TVA) invasion force in 8 the north. 9 2. Second, to restore security in the cities and towns. 10 3. Third, to restore security in the heavily populated 11 area of the countryside. 12 4. Fourth, to regain the initiative through offensive 13 operations. 14 C. Examination of the Options. The following questions are 15 posed which bring out the significance of each of the options 16 examined: 17 5. Wha military objectives are advanced by the option 18 (in six months; 12 months)? 19 6. hat specific dangers is the option designed to avoid 20 (in six months; 12 months)? 21 7. What specific goals does the option achieve (in six 22 an 12 months)? 23 8. Does it achieve the objectives? If not, where does 24 it fall short? What modifications of strategy and/or 25 objectives are indicated? 26 9. What personnel and procurement actions are required 27 COPY to support the option? L'TDGN SAINS JO10SOM LIBR&

low-6 SECTION II S L ' I /r".h1Y 1. The enemy, since November, has increased his forces In 1 South Vietnam by at least 41 maneuver battalions, sdne 2 armored elements, a large number of rockets, and additional 3 artillery, There are indications he is preparing for the use of 4 limited air support, including logistical air drops and .5 bombing mis;lIons. 6 2. In the MACV proposal (options I and 1A), the number of 7 maneuver battalions provided roughly offsets the increase in 8 enemy forces. In the lesser option:,, the enemy buildup is not 9 matched. Furthermore, there are indications now that addi- 10 tional enemy forces are on the move to RVN. 11 3. The basic strategy which must be followed by MACV in any 12 circumstances is to defeat the current enemy offensive both .13 in Northern I Corps Tactical Zone where it is the most . 14 formidable, in the Highlands where it is highly dangerous, and 15 throughout South Vietnam in defense of the government and the 16 " cities and tow[4s. In many places, allied forces have lost the 17 initiative to the enemy. They are meeting the threat in the I Corpis 18 Tactical Zone, are in a marginal position in II CTZ, and else- 19 where are committing the bulk of the South Vietnamese forces 20 to the defense of cities and towns. Allied forces are not 21 conduct'in-*ffensive operations of any great magnitude or =22 frequency and therefore they are not wresting control of--the 23 _ countryside from the enemy. 24 4. Under the smaller options, that is the current force plus 25 6 battalions already deployed (Option 2), or Option 3 which 26 COPY provides an additional 6 battalichÂ§l'w0thMn he 2MWW94t on, the capability to meet the enemy offentlve Ls definitely 28
S- SENSITIVE increased; however, this added capability may well be required 1 in the II Corps -Tactical Zone eLune. It may permit MACV to 2 break loose a small airborne or air cavalry reserve to conduct 3 reaction or limited offensive operations. The intermediate 4 Option I of 100,000 additional troops should permit the con- 5 stitution of about a one-division reserve which could rein- 6 force in any threatened area such as Khe Sanh or the Highlands 7 or could undertake slightly expanded offensive operations. 8 As long as the enemy employs the forces now available to him 9 in synchronized attacks, it is not realistic to believe that 10 this size force can guarantee security throughout South 11 Vietnam's rural areAs. However, the acco-pilishment of this 12 mission of providing secur ij y in the populated countryside 13 also depends very heavily on tha speed with which Vietnamese 14 forces recover and the effectiveness with which they are able 15 t6 operate. :L6 5. If the enemy offensive can be brc1r:en with sustained 17 heavy casualties, then, and only then, will the cities be 18 secure and the countryside reentered. Even with the largest 19 force contemplated (Option 1) it will not be possible to 20 perfortn-hv4 quately all of the tasks unless the current enemy 21 offensive is decisively defeated. This, therefore, is the 22 first and most important task upon which all else depends. 23 If the offensive can be broken, then all of the other tasks 24 become possible with the forces in Option 1. 25 COPY
J/ T - SENTSITIVE 6. It is not possible to predict whether the forces now 1 available in Vietnam will be able to break the offensive with- 2 out additional help, considering the magnitude of the enemy buildup and his clear willingness to expend forces with small 4 regard for casualties. Military prudence requires that we 5 react and respond to his escalation and initiative. The 6 larger and faster our response the better. It is not possible 7 to draw clear and compelling distinctions between the effects 8 to be expected from the incremental differences in the various 9 options. 10 7. If the forces now in Vietnam or the forces under any of 11 the options prove to be inadequate to break the enemy offen- 12 sive, or if,conversely. the enen'iy sustained offensive breaks 13 the Vietnamese armed forces (even short of destroying the GVN),. 14 then our objectives in South Vietnam and the tasks associated 15 w1th them wi]4 be unobtainable. Specifically, we would be 16 / unable to regain the initiative, that is, we would not be 17 ablp to'conduct offensive operations at the scope and pace 18 required either to prevent further enemy buildup or to reenter 19 the countryside. This would force US and allied forces into 20 a defeqqive posture around the major population centers. 21 8. The major risks involved in such circumstances are: 22 a. Enemy forces would retain the initiative and could 23 move a number of divisions now tied down along the borders 24 and around the Khe Sanh against the populated areas where 25 their attacks by fire would be de:%ora!i: Lng.

UT- SEISITIVE b. By holding the countryside, enemy (particularly VC) 1 strength would increase. 2 c. The enemy could consolidate both geographic areas and 3 segments of the population and probably could establish a 4 credible Revolutionary Government which, as a minimum, 5 would be a strong position for a negotiated settlement, but; 6 more importantly might bring about the collapse of the GVN 7 and the removal of any reason for US troops to remain in 8 South Vietnam. 9 9. Therefore, immediate action to break the enemy's 10 current offensive is not only the first but the decisive 11 requirement. 12 10. In each of the options discussed in the following 13 sections, sizeable. support forces are included which will 14 provide support not only for the additional combat troops 15 but also for those of the recent (Feb '68) emergency deploy- 16 / ments and he additional light ROK division soon to be deployed 17 -NOTE: 'The analysis of each of the options assumed the 1 approval, by separate action, of deferral of the civiliani- 19 zation program as prescribed in Program 5. This provided 20 an aritorized base-point strength level of 537,500 21 (525,000 Program 5 troop level PLUS an additional 12,500 22 spaces provided by deferral of the civilianization program). 2' Each of the force levels examined are additive to the 24 amended Program 5 force level of 537,500.) 25 L SCOPY LYND N BA NES 01 M O LIBA RY

M- SENSITIVE SECTION III - CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS A. It is concluded that: I 1. Additional deployments to Southeast Asia should commence 2 as soon as possible in order to defeat the present enemy offen- 3 sive, improve the security of allied forces in South Vietnam, 4 and regain the initiative. 5 2. The larger forces of OpAion I and IA will greatly 6 reduce risks to Free World forces in SVN and will accomplish 7 US objectives more rapidly than the forces of the other 8 options. 9 3. Restrictions on military operations in Southeast Asia 10 have prevented the most effective application of allied 11 military power. 12 4 . The current capability to respond appropriately to 13 additional force requirements is extremely limited. . 14 5 . Defi4jencies in personnel, equipment, and facilities 15 / cannot be overcome in time under present policies and pro- 16 ,gedures,, and requires extraordinary measures to accelerate 17 procurement and production. ;8 B. It is recommended that: ig J. Immediate actions be taken to provide forces of Option 20 1; specifically: 91 a.

Obtain selective industrial mobilization as required 6 to accomplish production of material necessary to equip 7 and sustain forces for the prosecution of the war. 8 e. Immediately accelerate procurement, to include 9 delegation of authority to the Services to negotiate non- 10 competitive cost reimbursable contracts. 11 2.

' '- SJEisS'i.[v~ SECTi*O't IV - THE THREAT ummri. Develop-nents in the past month indicate that the I communists have shifted to a more intensified level of military 2 activity in South Vietnam and Laos designed to influence the 3 outcome of the war. Indication's are that a cont'inuation of 4 this hish level of activity .s planned in South Vietnam with 5 complemcntary intensifications of military actions in North 6 Vietnam arid Laos. 7 Despite recent heavy losses, the VC/NVA is capable of 8 conducting major attacks in widespread border areas of South 9 Vietnam and co-tinuing attacks against urban areas and 10 district arid provincial capitals, although probably on a more 11 selective basis and reduced scale. It is estimated that the 12 VC/PA have adequate supplies to support major. attacks and 13 countr,-ide pressure. 14 At a maximum, within the next three to six months, the 15 VC/NVA could capture and control some of the major cities or 16 towns and caut a deterioration of GVN authority in the countryside and some urban areas. Apart from selective 18 attacks on cities and towns, it appears that the VC/NVA plan 19 to conduct sustained operations along more conventional lines 20 throughout I CTZ, including Khe Sanh and other strong points 21 along th!JMZ. They will also be heavily engaged in consoli- 22 dating their position in the countryside. Overall enemy 23 actions appear designed 'to bring about the fall of the GV1N 24 and to create a situation in which US presence would be 25 politically untenable. 26 COPY LIMDON BAINES JOICiSON LIBRARY iwl- %JI A11b
-,' - SPISITIVE M1litary actions in North Vietnam appear designed to 1 support thc! increased activity in the south, and possibly to 2 include aerial harassment in northern South Vietnam. In Laos, 3 the enemy exparision of activity appears designed to divert . 4 attention from the main battlefield in South Vietnam and bring 5 increao-ed preosure on US-Thal-Lotian relations, creating, 6 perhaps, a demand for US military support in Laos and Thailand. 7 (See Appendix A for detailed discussion of enemy capabilities 8 and probably future courses of action.) 9 CO" copy "- LY3DO4 MAINES JOMUSOM LIBRIARY ~OrM
- SENSITIVE II SECTION V - OPTION 1 1. Option 1. Add approximately 196,000 troops to present total 1 authorized force level, i.e., Program 5 (525,000), plus the six 2 additional battalions already deployed (10,500). This gives 3 COMUSMACV 133 maneuver battalions - 25 more than nor in country. 4 Under this option, restrictions currently imposed on air and ground 5 operations in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam are relaxed to 6 permit destruction of the ports, mining of waterways, attack of 7 complete target system and offensive operations against Viet Cor/ 8 North Vietnamese Army forces which threaten South Vietnam. 9 2. Concept. The heart of the concept of operations is to defeat 10 the current enemy offensive throughout South Vietnam while taking 11 all necessary measures to keep the Government of Vietnam intact and 12 operating. .jnce this has been. accomplished then the initiative .an 13 be regained and the accomplishment of all necessary tasks will be 1 possible. In support of concept, forces are provided to match the 15 November- December buildup of*North Vietnamese Army forces in 16 South Vietnam, to constitute a theater reserve of sufficient size 17 loth to meeticontingencies and take advantage of opportunities, and 18 J'I to provide assistance and encouragement of ARVN forces to move out. 19 from the population centers and reestablish security in the country- - side. Removal of restrictuions under this option would permit the attack of previously unauthorized target systems, including the 22 ports;','V removal of geographical restrictions on the air/naval 23 S campaign against North Yietnam- the destruction of all-military 24 targets in North Vietnam regardless of location of proximity to 25 population centers. 26 3.

M*T - SENSITIVE to havc provided suffic4ent support to the RMNAF to :;u&t ri- tially reduce the threat of major enemy attack on South Vietam citje, in the Tet pattern. The security of Saigon and pro- vincial capitals and the Government of Vietnam would be vir- tually assured although periodic attacks by fire could be expected. The enemy would still have the capability 6f mess- ing its forces for occassional attacks against key objectives, but would be unable to enter the cities in force. Standoff attacks by fire would continue to be made with regularity. (2) In 12 months, wit,11 the entire additive force closed in-country and, assuming no additional enemy forces are 1 deployed, the threat to the security of the cities and the 1 Government of Vietnam would be further reduced as the exten- 1 sion of security into the countryside reduced the likeliho)d 1 of standoff attacks by fire. 1 b.

(1) In six months, th) enemy may still be in control of 1 large portions of the South Vietnam countryside. Those addi- !L tional forces which would be able to close within six months 1 would be applied to higher priority tasks and therefore would 2 not provide a capability to change appreciably the present 2 situation with respect to Viet Cong contested and controlled 2 areas.,, However, the arrival of additional US forces, even 2 though not committed directly to the support of the pacifica- 24 tion program, would encourage the ARVN to expand their opera- 25 tions in the countryside, thus providing a certain measure of 26 increased security for pacification. 27 '(2) In 12 montho, the generally higher level of secu'rity 28 provided by expanding US operations against Viet Cong/North 29 Vietnam Army main forces would have made a m6re direct con- 30 tribution to the extension of security in the countryside. It 31 is likely, therefore, that markedly favorable t Wds would have 32 been established by that time. LmDO, SAIS JOSO4 LIBRARY33 - SENSITIVE Option 1 V-2 Section V
20PV - SENSITIVE c. Defense of the Bordersthe DMZ, and the Northern Provinces (1) In six months, the present danger to US/Government :)f Vietnam/Free World 1.ilitary Assistance Force in I CTZ wou,-d be substantially reduced. This would be the result of increased US combat strength there and also of expanded offensive opera- tions against the enemy in North Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; the achievement of a fully satisfactory logistical posture within I CTZ; and the constitution of a substantial theater reserve. (2) In 12 months, assuming no additional enemy deployments, the current enemy offensive would have been broken. The logistical situation, would have become fully satisfactory. ] The higher allied force levels in I CTZ would not necessarily 1 lead to early decisive defeat of the substantial enemy forces there, given the proximity of North Vietnam and major enemy reinforcements. Allied forces should find it possible to take 1 the offensive in selected areas, particularly as they can be reinforced by the theater reserve. However, the requirements 1 to reinforce in other threatened areas, as in the case o'f the 2 II CTZ at present, would tend to limit the availability of the 2 threater reserve. 2 d.

Of7ensive Operations 2 (1) In six months, the additional forces which have arrived 2 in-countrt would have largely been applied to higher priority 2 tasks and, therefore, offensive operations would still be - 2 relatively infrequent and on 6 relatively modest scale. 2 .(2) In 12 months, the arrival in-country of the remainder 2 of additive forces under this option would have permitted an 2 increasing tempo of offensive operations.

TiOY E11- SENSITIVE 10. l,ogistic Implications I a. Materiel availability is the most critical pacing factor 2 related to Option I. In order to increase significantly the: 3 rate of military production to support forces required for 4 this alternative, it will be necessary to obtain supplemental 5 appropriations, accelerated production, and resort to select-ve 6 industrial mobilization. Executive or Congressional action 7 must be taken immediately if military production requirements 8 are to be met on a timely basis. 9 b. Thi best index of the limitations imposed upon the mil,tary 10 under the current rate of industrial production are the produc- 11 tion lead times for major military end items. 12 (1) Helicopters - 12 to 18 Months. Without industrial 13 mobilization, there is no "get-well" date for helicopter 14 deliveries at this time. 15 (2) Ammunition - 6 to 19 Months. Longest lead-time 16 g ground-ammunition items are those now produced at the .17 a|
maximum rate with available facilities. To increase pro- 18 duction significantly, facilities must be expanded. 19 (3) Communications/Electronid Equipment - 15 to 18 Months. 20 0 There are significant shortages which will not be alleviated 2. until tbe 1970-1971 time period at the present rate of 22 production. 23 (4) Aircraft. Current aircraft production schedules 24 result in lead times of 8 to 24 months for aircraft other 25 than helicopters. Under mobilization, accelerated deliveries 26 uwl'id commence in i:ight months for A-37 aircraft arid 12-months 27 for F-4E aircraft :from commencement of maximum effort. Ai- 28 craft engines are one of the major pacing long lead-time 29 items. The examples given above are illustrative of major 30 logistic problem areas. COPY' 33 MLDOY BAINES JOHSO. LIBRARY
C. The following are priority items for which increased production is considered necessary to sustain support of forces considered in this course of action: (1) Helicopters '2) Aircraft (3) Communications/Electronic Equipment (4) Ground Ammunition, Naval Gun Ammunition and Explosives (5) Earthmoving and Materials Handling Equipment (6) Spare Parts (7) Vehicles 1 (8) Air-launched Missiles 1 (9) Small Arms (M-16 Rifle) 1 d. Industrial mobilization is required not only to - fill the materiel needs of the existing US Active and Reserve 1 structure, but also to replenish stocks drawndown from other 1 US forces to support these deployments and to provide the 1 required industrial production capacity. Foremost in magni- 1 tude of the drawdowns are those associated with our war 1 reserve operational projects and pre-positioned stocks. 1 Restoration of the CONUS-su:.taining base will be required.. 2
The mobilization reserves of clothing, construction items, 2 and genersl supplies are below required levels. While the 2 .lead-tim--s for these items are not as long as those associ- 2 ated with major equipment, funds should be made available to 24 reconstitute these reserves. 2 e. The RVNAF Modernization Program must be supported. 26 Delays thave occurred In providing the RVNAF with quantlties 2 of M16 rifles and M79 grenade launchers required to meet 28 requirements. COMUSMACV has indicated an immediate require- 29 ment for an additibnal 268,000 M16 rifles, and 11,200 M79 30 launchers. In addition, a shortaae of :60 machinecns; 31 anti-tank- LIDON BAINES JOWSO.

6 miW'PM.T- -E N! S IT I VE f. To support additional planned force deployments additional funds will be required to provide additional facilities, battle damage repair in SVN, LOC and port improvements. g. As a consequence of the above, it is essential that the four steps listed below be taken as soon as possible: (1) Authorize limited or selective industrial mobilization. (2) Authorize the expenditure of funds to provide additional facilities, tooling, and procurement of long lead- 1 time items required by manufacturers and related subcon- 1 tractors for accelerated production and to provide 1 additional industriAl repair capacity. (3) Establish and maintain increased production rates until initial equipment requirements, drawdowns from . Reserve units, and pre-positioned war reserve stocks have. 1 been brought up to the authorized levels worldwide. 1 (4) Provide additional funds for the Military 1 Constr,ction Program in SVN. 1 h. Operations in areas other than SVN would require 2 an improvement and extension of the land LOC's. The magnitud," 2 of the increased construction effort to provide the required 2 LOCs would be dependent upon the -magnitude and duration of 2 pro fed operations and the distance of those operations from 2' existing bases. 2

SECTION VI - OPTION IA 1. Option IA. No change f.rom Option I except that curcent' 1 restrictions on ground and air operations in Cambodia, Laos 2 and NVN arn maintaine-d. 3 2. Concept. The 196,000 additional troops provided under this Option w.,ould be applied to the same priority tasks 5 envisaged under Option 1, with highest priority to the security 6 of the GVN in Saigon and provincial capitals and to countering -7 and NVA invasion force in the north. The maintenance of 8 current restrictions on ground and air operations in Cambodia, 9 Laos, and NVN would prevent the application of increased 10 pressures against the enemy which could increase the threat 11 posed by NVA forces in SVA. As a consequence, a somewhat 12 larger portion of the additive US forces would be required 13 in I CTZ in order to counter to some degree the greater enemy 14 threat there. Offensive operations by allied forces in SVN 15 would be opposed by larger, better equipped and better 16 supported enemy forces. The threat to the security of the 17 cities would be relatively greater under this Option than 18
under Option 1 and, therefore, would be less effectively 19 countered by the same forces. However, the substantial 20 additions to US troop strength under this Option would make 21 it possible to support the extension of security and of GVN .22 control into the countryside. In addition, it would be possible 23 to conduct extensive offensive operations to maintain a steady r24 erosion of VC/NVA military strength in SVN. 25 3. E tittive on MACV Objectives. 26 a.

To the extent that offensive operations 30 COPY under Option 1A are less eff.'t-ive than un.d=D&.PAO 0BRAR0
- L II~ ~ V J.: (because a stronger enemy is confronted under Option 1A), pacification operations would have less effective protection 2 from enemy main forcP operations and thus proceed at a slower 3 pace. The difference would probably be appreciable principally 4 in the more reraote areas. 5 c. Defense of the Borders, DMZ, and the Northern Provinces. 6 Restrictions on offensive operations into the border 7 sanctuaries provide the enemy the capability to reconstitute 8 his forces rapidly after operations and a safe facility to 9 stockpile weapons and munitions to refurbish his in-country 10 stocks at time and places of his own choosing. Retention 11 of these restrictions under this option adds to the time 12 required for US/GVN/FWNAF to accomplish the military objectives 13 and tasks and requires a larger and more responsive friendly 14 force to counter the options provided to the enemy by the 15 sanctuaries. 16
d. Offensive Operations. Because of the greater 17 effectiveness of the enemy to oppose the achievement of 18 US objectives under this Option as contrasted with 19 Option 1 (with its intensified offensive ground and air 20 operations in WVN, Cambodia, and Laos), somewhat larger US 21 forces would be required for the accomplishment of the 22 higher priority objectives. For this reason, allied offensive 23 operations would be conducted with smaller forces against 24 more effective enemy forces and would, consequently, be less 25 effective. 26 4. 7?ha1ysis. 27 a.

Logist'c Implications 22 -- This option is influenced by the same materiel and 23 construction considerations as Option 1. 24 Under this alternative there is a requirement to improve 25 LOCs A4.,facilities to support those additonal forces to be 26 deployed to Thailand. 27
SECTION VII - OPTION 2 1. Option_2. No change to present total authorized force levA, 1 i.e. Program 5 (525,000) plus the six additiional battalions alr*ady 2 deployed (10,000) except to add three fighter squadrons requested 3 by CIN.F'AC and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This gives 4 COMUSMACV 112 maneuver battalions. The additional fighter squadrons 5 are within the 525,000 ceiling. 6 2. Concept. Priority for the use of US forces would be applied 7 to the essential tasks: first, to break the current enemy offensive; 8 the security of the Government of Vietnam in Saigon and the pro- 9 vencial capitals and the defense of the northern provinces. The 10 Arm ofVienam (ARVN) would continue to be supported to the extent I Army of Vietnm(l..oudcniu o espotd oteetn 11 required to reduce to an-acceptable risk, the threat to the security 12 of the cities and the Government of Vietnam. The enemy threat in 13 the I CTZ would continue to require over 50 percent of all US 7-, maneuver battalions. The remaining US forces would be hard pressed to withstana major enemy offensives elsewhere, and might sufferzsome 1 serious reverses. They cannot now provide adequately for the 17 security of the countryside, or conduct offensive operations on a 18 sufficiently broad scale to regain the initiative. 19
3. Effect *n01 Military Objectives 20 a. Security of Cities and the Government of Vietnam 21 () In six months the US/Government of Vietnam/Free World 22 Military Assistance Force (FWMAF) would still be in full - 23 control of Siagon and the provjncial capitals and the Govern- 24 would still be in existence. Periodic enemy attacks on 25 the cities must b. expected, principally by fire-but occa- 26 sionally with enemy combat forces. If ARVN does not prove 27 to have the stamina to withstand sustained pressure at all 28 poin"ts, seizure and temporary holding of some district arid 29 * " ,-, 't ..COPY * some province capitals wo._, become -= the ei-emy completed his recovery fr-.:n Tet losses. 31 fr
(2) If the enemy offe;nslve Js not broker, in 12 months, t!o 1 enemy COUld achleve the capablity to so isolate many provJn- 2 cial capitals that his subStantial control of a number of them 3 would become Increasingly probable. A continuation of this 4 situation would lead to a confinement of the Government of. 5 Vietnam authority to the largest cities. 6 b. Security in the Countryside 7 (1) In six months, without a marked improvement in the s1ze 8 and effectiveness of RVNAF beyond pre-Tet levels, allied forces 9 would lack the capability. to substantially reduce Viet Cong 10 controlled and contested areas. As long as these conditions 11 exist the Viet Cong can recruit to offset losses, may gain In 12 strength and could consolidate political control. 13 (2) In 12 months, the enemy would be in control of the major 14 part of the South Vietnam countryside. Only in the most pop- 15 ulated areas would a US/Government of Vietnam/FW.AF presence 16 be maintained and the Government of Vietnam control effected. 17 c. Defense of the Borders, the DMZ, and the Northern Provinbes. 18
(1) In six months, the present situ",ion may still obtain, 19 i.e., large allied ground forces may still be required to meet 20 the threat of a major enemy force which however, avoids deci- 21 sive com!at. On the other hand, a major battle may have been 22 fought. Regardless of the outcome of such a battle, the need 23 to retain substantial Government of Vietnam/US/RVNAF forces in 24 the I CTZ will remain. Without an in-country reserve MACV 25 would be hard pressed to cope with a synchronized series of 26 s ii aneous attacks and might suffer some serious reverses. 27 (2) In 12 months, the enemy would have had addi.tional time 28 to creat new forces and reinforce his units in the I CTZ and 29 along the Laotian/Cambodian borders increasing the risk to 30 allied forces there. 31 * --o B--ES -OS-M LIBRACOPY V F - 1.1I.4DUN BANES JOWMSOM LIBRARY
d. Offensive Operations I (1) In six months, allied forces, at present levels, and 2 lacking an in-country reserve, would have been able to cor- 3 duct only infrequent and small scale offensive operations. 4 (2) In 12 months, the increased strength of the enew.X 5 position in the countryside would make offensive operations 6 increasingly more difficult and less productive. 7 4. Analysis 8 a. Advantages. There are no military advantages inherent 9 in this option. In every respect, the situation would 10 become increasingly disadvantageous for US/GVN/FWMAF, even 11 if they were able to prevent the enemy from inflicting serious' 12 reverses on them. 13 b. Dangers 14 (1) In six months the enemy main force threat to 15 US/GVN/F1.R4AF could be substantially increased, with allied 16 forces suffering high casualties. The enemy could have 17 strengthened his position in heretofore contested areas 18 and enter areas previously under GVN control, thus gaining 19 control of additional human and materiel resources and reduc- 20
Ing GVN coritro l..-!iie"i iiaeF-s-heniay .be able- to organ*ize" 21 some form of credible revolutionary front or even to foment 22 in cert4n areas an uprising against the government. By 23 / major attacks on Saigon and other major cities and by 2 encirclement and harassment of populated areas, the enemy 25 could make increasingly obvious the inability of the GVN 26 to provide security to its people, to gain their 27 allegiance or to control them. 28 a') In 12 months; it is likely that this trend would be 29 substantially more apparent, with serious implications for 30 the future of the GVD in S1.U and of the United States in 31 LUDO- BAINES JOH4SOM LIBRARY
5. Stratei-ic !,odifications. if Opticn 2 is selected, no modifi- I cation would be de,irable of the objectives of defeating the ene: y 2 offensive and enemy forces in I Corps, rcztoration of security in 3 the cities and the countryside, and regainin: of the initiative 4 through offensive action. Selection of this option would not off- 5 set the recent enemy buildup, however, and if the enemy continues 6 his buildup and his current strategy, the ability of friendly 7 forces to attain the objectives of securing the countryside and re- 8 gaining the initiative through offensive action would be severely 9 restricted. 10 6. Conclusion. The US objective in SVN cannot be achieved in 11 the foreseeable future by US forces at current levels if the 12 Vietnamese government and armed forces remain in a defensive 13 posture. Without additional US help they are unlikely to regain 14 control of the countryside. Recent experience and the kno'nm cape.- 15 bility of the enemy to reinforce his units in SII, demonstrate 16 that US forces at present levels are unable to accomplish all of 17
the tasks necessary to the attainment of the US objective in SVN. 18 At present levels, US forces can be expected to come under increas- 19 ingly grave threats to their security, with a high probability of 20 ingreased casualties, even though they cannot be driven from SVI 21 / by force. - 22 7_ Requiv'ed Personnel Actions 23 a.

SECTIOJ VIII - OPTION 3 I. Oution 3. Add 50,000 troops above the approximately I 535,000 iti Option 2. This gives COMJSMACV 113 maneuver 2 battalions -- six more than the 112 under Option 2. 3 2. Concept. Priority for the use of US forces would I continue to be applied to the essential tasks, the security 5 of GVN in Saigon and provincial capitals and the defense 6 of the northern provinces. The additional 50,000 troops would 7 make it possible to reduce the risk of a major enemy success 8 in the event of a recurrence of the Tet attacks against the 9 cities. Most of the 50,000 troops would, however, be utilized .0 in the I CTZ in order to augment US fighting strength there. 11 These troops would increase the capability of the US commander 12 to respond in accordance with the threats and opportunities which 13 can be expected to develop, as well as to reduce the currently 14 substantial danger to his lines of communication and .esupply i, to his forces at Khe Sanh and along the DMZ. The deployment of
additional Marine and Army armored and mechanized forces into 1.7 the DMZ area might release elements of airborne or air cavalry 18 di,visions to nstitute the beginnings of a contingency reserve. 19 At the moment. these reserves are required in the II CTZ. This 20 optijon wbuld not provide enough additional forces to expand 21 .significantly security and GVE! control in the countryside nor to 22 conduct major offensive operations with any frequency outside 23 the I qTZ. 24 3. Effect on IACV Objectives 25 a. Security of Citfes and GVN 26 (1) In six months, the US/GN/1FWMAF would still be in 27 full control of Saigon and the provincial capitals and 28 the GWT would be more firmly in conti-! in the p6&+lated 29 . .er i Ld iD O N B AeWne mO LsB A R Y3 areas. Periodic enemy attacks on th;- cities wo~u ;'e 0 BAR~
largely by fire and only rarely with combat forces, I p although the enemy retains the possibility to seize and 2 hold for a period portions of major cities not defended 3 by, or in the vicinity of, major allied units. 4 (2) In 12 months, the situation would be essentially 5 the same as at six months, both with respect to continued 6 GVN control in the populated areas and the capability of 7 the enemy to concentrate for damaging attacks from time 8 to time. 9 b. Security in the countryside. 10 (1), In six months, the enemy would still be in control 11 of large portions of the SVN countryside. The additional 12 forces provided under this option would not provide a 13 capability to change appreciably the present situation 14 with respect to VC contested and controlled areas. 15 (2) In 12 months, the situation would be essentially 16 the same as in six months with little progress being 17 made in the extension of GVN control. c. Defense of the Borders, the DMZ and the Northern 19 I/ Provinces. 20 (1) In six months (approximately 4 months after the 21 arrival of the 50,000 additional troops), the situation 22 in I CTZ would be less dangerous for US/GVN/F1WMAF. 23 The enemy forces would be present in strength, possibly 24 xeliforced over prVsent levels. Even with the additional 25 troops, allied forces would lack the capability to 26 inflict a major defeat on the very large forces now 27 ( opposing them. On the other hand, the additional troops 28 would reduce the risk ol" a major en: - attack resulting -0 iOY in a serious allied revel-se, Llr-00*4 MIES JOWSO.- RAY3 44PI& 0% r"M
A & (2) In 12 months the situation would be essentially I the same as at six months, I.e. allied forces would be 2 better able to defend themselves against an enemy attack 3 but would still lack the capability to inflict a decisive 4 defeat on the enemy in I CTZ. A large portion of allied 5 military strength would, as at present, be tied down 6 by the threat posed by large enemy forces. 7 d. O'fensive Operations 8 (I" In six months, allied forces, at present levels, 9 would have been able to conduct only infrequent and small 10 scale offensive operations. 11 (2) In 12 months, the increased strength of the 12 enemy position in the countryside would make offensive 13 operations increasingly more difficult and less productive. 1 4. Analysis. 15 a. Advantages. An important advantage of this option 16 is the possibility it offers of constituting the beginnings 17 of a reserve needed now in view of an enemy buildup in the 18 II CTZ. The additional forces would provide a measure of 19 flexibilitylto allied operations and decrease the likelihood 20 of substantial deterioration in the allied position in I CTZ 21 and elsewhere. There would be a somewhat reduced risk to 22 Saigon and the municipal capitals and hence to the existence 23 of the GVN. However, the additiona-1 forces provided under 24 this " Jon would not permit substantial progress toward the 25 extension of security and GVN: control in the countryside end 2E the decisive defeat of enemy forces in SVN. 27 b. Dan&ers._. 28 (1) In six months, the increase in US combat unit strength 29 coPY superimposed on a force ,ho :_ lo-i-ti 11 before their arrival, may well have z'esulted in a serialu.31
- SENSITIVE defIcient logistical situation. Under this option, the 1 enemy would retain his control over certaln areas in the 2 countryside and we would began to lose the contested 3 areas. (2) In 12 months, we would have largely lost control 5 of the countryside and probably would have been reduced 6 to an enclave concept around the major cities. 7 5. Strategic 1Iodifications. If Option 3 is selected, no mod- 8 Ification is desirable in the objective of defeating the enemy 9 offensive and enemy.forces in I Corps, restoration of security 10 in the cities and the countryside, and regaining of the initia- 11 tive through offensive action. The entire force deployed under 12 this option would be required to offset the enemy build-up in 13 I Corps, however, and although a small, brigade size theatre 14 reserve might be developed from the deployed force, the ability 15 of availab]e forces to counter the enemy threat at the borders 16 and at the same time provide forces to assist RVNAF forces to 17 reenter the countryside, and to undertake offensive operations 18 against enemy forces in SVN would be seriously restricted. 19
6. Conclusion. The additional 50,000 troops provided under 20 this option are insufficient to counter the enemy offensive, 21 to restore se"rity in the countryside, and to regain the 22 initiative. We probably could secure the cities, but these 23 addLtional US forces may not even match additional N.orth Viet- 24 namese Ar:my reinforcements apparently already on the move. 25 7.

T- S I:'STIVE SECTIONi IX - OPTIOIJ 4 1. Optlon 1. Add 100,000 troops above the approximately 535,000 In Option 2. This gives COMUSMACV ].24 maneuver battalions-- 12 more than the 112 under Option 2. 2. Concept. The 100,000 additional troops would make it possible for the highest priority tasks (the security of GVN in Saigon and provincial capitals and the defense of the northern provinces) to be accomplished satisfactorily. In addition, they would make it possible to constitute at least a one division reserve for use as a reaction force; to begin to reestablish security in the countryside; and to conduct some offensive opera- 1 tions against enemy main forces and base areas. The ability to 1 conduct some offensive operations would restore a measure of 1 initiative to allied co.nanders but the forces provided under this 7 option would not assure an early and decisive defeat of enemy forces or the rapid extension of security to the countryside. 1 Considerinc 1he inadequacy of forces in II CTZ this reserve 1 f, ce might well be totally com-mitted in that area. In other 17 words, this level of additional force would not promise early 18 attairunent of US objectives in SVN. 19 3. Effect on MACV Objectives 20
a. Security of Cities and GVN 21 (l) In six months, the security of Saigon and the 22 provincial capitals aid the GVN would be virtually assured 23 although periodic enemy attacks by fire could be expected. 24 The enemy would retain the capability of massing his 25 ice. for o-.casicf&nal attacks against key objectives, but 26 would -,ot be able to seize and hold them for extended 27 periods as in the case of Hue during the recent Tet offensive. 28 (2) In 12 ronths, with the eritire additive force closed 29 in-.cuntry, the Ut-::-eat to the secbi r ty of the &Pes n- 3 LY:4DU BANES JOHVSON LIBRARY the G1N would be further rcd,cA. 31 K .
b. Security in the Countryside (1) In six months, the enemy would still be in control of lav'p portions of the SVN countryside. Those additional for.cez. which would be aile to close within six months "would not p!:,ViJe a capability to change appreciably the present situation with respect to VC contested and controlled areas. (2) In 12 months, with all of the additional forces closecd in-country, the extension of security in the country- side would have begun, with a concomitant extension of GVN control.. It is unlikely that large additional areas would come under GVN contol within 12 months but markedly favorable 1 trendz. s' ould be established. i c. Defense of the Borders, the DMZ, and the Northern Provinces 1- (1) In six months, *he situation in Â£ CTZ would be 1 substantially less dangerous for US/GVN/FWMAF. The enemy 15 force. would be present in strength, possibly reinforced 16 over Dresent levels. However, the additional US troops would 11 make p-_.-Ssible the establishment of an in-country reserve. Of IE parGic,.11ar importance, the additional units provided under'. 19 this option include the combat service support units needed 20 to co7rrect the poor logistical situation of the forces in 21 positltn at Khe Sanh and along the DMZ.

-SENSI TIVE d. Offensivce Operations. (1) In six months, the additional forces which had A. arrived in-country would have been applied to higher 2 priority tasks, and therefore, any offensive operations 3 would be infrequent and sall-scale. 4 (2) In 12 months, the arrival in-country of all the 5 additional forces provided by this option would permit 6 offensive operations at higher levels but not at such a 7 level as to have a decisive impact on enemy forces and base- 8 areas for some time. 9 4. Analysis 10 a. Advantages. The principal advantages of this option are 11 in the provision of additional forces which could be employed to 12 provide increased security for Saigon and municipal capitals and 13 hence to the existence of the GVN; the additional combat strength 14 and badly needed improvement of the logistical posture of th, 15
forces in I CTZ; and the capability to b.egin to conduct offen- 16" sive operations and to extend GVN control in the countryside. 17 b. DangerS. This option offsets most but not all of t.e .T- 1 buildup since Noveiber., The 100,000 additional forces dD not 19 provide thelcapability to inflict an early decisive defeat on 20 the enemy. The danger inherent in this situation is not so 21 much military as political: It subjects GVN and RVNAF to pr.)- 22 longed pressure and does not provide a basis for an early end 23 to the war. 24 5. Sttegc Modification. If Option 4 is selected, no modi-fi- 25 cation is desirable in th& objectives of defeating the enemy 26 offensive and ene:.y fo:rces in I Corps, restoration of security in 27 the cities and the countryside, and regaining of the initiative 28 through- offensive action. Selection of thi' option wc,, partially 29 offset the enemy build-up since :k:vember an., woLuiO ,eTSdWRA-PBRo ment of a theatre reserve of two or three bi'Igades to counter enemy 31 offensive operations in II and III Corps. It would permit assistance 32
- SENSITIVE to RVIAF i,n accomplishing the objective of restoration of the 1 pacificaticn effort in the countryside, but would not guarantee 2 the ability to undertake early and sustained offensive operations 3 to inflict deoisive defeat on enemy forces. 4 6. Conclusion. The additional 100,O00 troops provided under 5 this option will enable allied forces to deny the enemy major 6 successes in South Vietnam and to resume some security operations 7 in the countryside. These additional forces will not, however,. 8 enable allied forces soon to destroy the enemy in South Vietnam. 9 7. Required Personnel Actions 10 a. Army. Overall, the STRAF is drawn dolan to 60 percent lull 11 TOE (STRAF divisions to 42 percent full TOE). Callup of Reserves 12 and extension of terms of service are required. With extension 13 of terms of service, the trained strength recovers in September 14 1968. 90,000 Reserve personnel in units and as individuals are 15 called to active duty. Additional Reserves must be mobilized in 16 FY 1969 to replace those deployed and to restore the base to 17
ase o17 a short tour ratio for DFEs to 1:1. USAREUR will also be drawn 18 down to support this option plus 8,500 to Korea. Active Army 19 increase will be 130,892 personnel. Total Army end-strength 20 forces is 220,802 (which reflects the termination of RVN 21 i civilianiza-ion program). 22 b. Navy. All of the Navy requirements.would be additional 23 t o the Niavy's present force structure and would have to be 24 provided for by Reserve call-up, extension of terms of service, 25 etc. (11,723 personnel). Although.there are N,MCBs in the 26 force:Wbucture not currently deployed, they deploy in rota- 27 tion with those? in-country and would have to be replaced by 28 Reserve NMCBs if they deployed. Two Reserve NICBs (1,700 29 personnel) would have to be called for each additional M,ICB 30 deployed to the Republic of Vietnam. 31 COPY c. Marine Corps.

The materiel requirements to support deployments under, this alternative can be supported. Most combat essential equipment shortages can be resolved through withdrawal of equipment from active and reserve units located, within CONUS. However, significant shortages of M16 rifles cannot be resolved in this maner. Unless production is increased,
forces may deploy with older type rifles. 1 b. Withdrawals and redistribution of critical assets would further deplete the combat essential materiel in the hands of 2 the active and reserve forces. These withdrawals would have 2 I to be mada up as a matter of urgency. Increased funding for procurement of replacement materiel would be necessary to 2 return the remaining active and reserve to combat ready status 2 and to maint-In a CODTJS sustaining base for logistic support. 2 c. The RVNAF IModdernization Program must be supported. 2 De!,rPj have occured In providing the RVNAF with quantities of 2 M]" rifles an.] M79.:grenade launchers required to meet 2 requirements.

However, the movement of support forces to I Corps. 3 from these Zones to support increaFed requirements in that 4 area has resulted in a reduction in support capability which 5 cannot be alleviated unless additional support troops are 6 provided and the civilianization program is deferred as 7 requested by C0MfJSMACV.

He 3 cozmmittud over 67,000 combat maneuver forces plus perhaps 4 25% or 17,000 more impressed men and boys, for a total of 5 about 84,000. He lost 40,000 killed, at least 3,000 detainees 6 who VWou]d beco-Me PWs, and perhaps 5,000 disabled or died of 7 Wounds. lie had peaked his force total to about 260,000 just 8 before Tet, by hard recruiting, infiltration, civilian 9 irnrires.rme.t, and draw-downs on service and guerrilla personnel. 10 In the offensive he has lost about one-fifth of his total 11 strength. About two-thirds of his trained, organized unit 12 strength can continue offensive action. Infiltration is 13 continUing and recruiting is being pressed in the countryside 1.4 while Allied forces are securing the urban areas. The enemy 15 appear-s to have adequate munitions, stockpiled in-country 16 arid available through the D11Z, Laos, and Cambodia, to support 17 continud maj.o attacks and countrywide pressure; foQd pro- 18 / curcment may be a problem. 19 2.

In addition, the Communists are capable of maintaining 5 economic, psychological, and military pressure on the cities 6 noted above as well as the following: Quang Ngai, Kontum, Pleiku, Ban Me Thuot, Qul Nhon, Tuy Hoa, Nha Trang, Dalat, 8 Phan ThlIet, Song Be, Xuan Loc, Bien Hoa, Vinh Long, and other 9 provincial towns of political significance to the enemy. 10 B. ASSESSMEHT OF FUTURE THREAT IN SOUTH VIETNAM 11 1. Developments during the past five weeks have made it 12 clear that the Communists now plan to put extensive and 13 sustained military pressure on the urban areas of South 14 Vietnam. At a maximum, within the next three to six months, 15 they could move in and control some of the major cities; 16 failing this, they could attempt to bring about a deterioration 17 of goverrnmental authority in urban areas, as well as in the 18 countryside, that eventually would be severe enough to force 19 a political acSonmodation in the war on Communist terms. 20 / 2. There have also been a number of indications, apart 1 from the attacks on the cities, that additional shifts in -22 Communist war strategy are in process. Among these has been 23 evidence of plans possibly to use the North Vietnamese air 24 arm in a limited logistic or attack role in South Vietnam. 25 New Communist weapons incllding tanks and possibly better 26 artillery rockets have appeared in the DR7 area. Signs 27 pointing to new troop infiltration to the South have been 28 noted, while the flow of supplics to the D-Z and down the 29 Lao corridor h.s continued at a steor:-d-up *c-. Additcobal 30 LYNDoN BAINES JO1SON LIBRARY enemy road building has also bee'r. under y tr h:h wIll 31 improve the Communists' ability to sup Ort military u,nits ,- 2
1h both thc DMZ arid the coastal area of the two nocthl-rn Prby1r.E.3 in South Vietnam. 2 3. The developir1ents suggest that the enemy is trying to get in a po ;ition through 1st Corps which will permit him 4 to coVduct sustained offensive operations, probably along 5 more conventional military lines than ever before in the war. 6 Recently the bulk of one division of Communist troops from 7 the DMZ area has slipped south into the coastal plains of 8 Quang Tri and, along with NVAlelements already in the 9 sector, '.:i!l probably attempt a campaign to erode and destroy 10 friendly control over, the rural population and the cities in 11 the area. It appears that the Communists are going to make 12 a major effort to invest or capture Quang Tri, and, if 13 possible, gain de facto administrative control over Thua 14 Thien and Quang Tri provinces. 15 4. Continued pressure on the Allied bastion at Khe Sanh is 16 likely in the course of the Communist effort in the north. 17 Whether Harioi will make an all-out effort to overrun the 18 base within the next 30-60 days remains to be seen. It is 19 'possible th,a he plans at present only to mount a long-term 20 siege operation against the base. In any event, the enemy 121 i seekin- to tie down a substantial Allied reaction fcrce. 22 5. We believe the most likely course of over-all enemy 23 action in Vietnam during the next year will revolve around 2; a majork %ffort in the north and in the central highlands 25 combined with selective pressure against the urban areas 26 farther- south. The pressure against the cities will probably 27 include both limited ground probes and coordinated attacks 28 by fire.

The movement of NVA forces southeastward in Quang Tri 7 Province has been accompanied during the past three weeks by 8 an expansion of North Vietna.-U.se military pressure in a "9 southwtsterly direction within Laos. Little Communist effort 10 has been expended elsewhere and it is unlikely they will 11 attempt an all-out effort in the north. In the south, the 12 Laotian provincial capital of Saravane, at the northern 13 approach to the Bolovens plateau, has been surrounded and 14 harassed by North Vietnamese troops. North-South Route 23 15 runs throi:gh Saravane, and the town also serves as a buffer 16 for the rich, rice-producing Sedone valley which came under 17 full Lao control only last year. Accord!ng to one POW, the 18 Curnrnunists plan to take the town and also the more important '19 government bQ;pe camps south of it at Lao Ngam and Ban Thaterig. 20 / The Cor:,munist threat agaXnst Att-opeu has also been acti*e and 21 se-lzure of. the town may be planned. 22 2. It is possible that the .North Vietnamese plan to expand 23 the fighting in Laos, possibly in combination with an effort 2.4 to sp;,u' further unrest in Cambodia and a new outbreak of 25 insurgent activity in Thailand. They might hope to acconplish 26 furt:e r tLinr'eing of US military resour;-.. in Vietnam by 27 ,,, ,, to deploy rroo4 into Lao!3 or Thpiland. ver! -2PY if the U. did riot react with troops, fl;3inol mi,-ht hope that 29 the threat created in Laos wol;!d cu',z;< -...';d t?.O r 30 " LYNDON BA[NES JOHNSON LIBRARY issuri and po.sibly deter or de.a:w th a. .,;v- 10 1 31 commitr ents in Vietnam. ., i-, '2

We do not see any signs 6 of North Vietnamese intent to expand hostilities elsewhere In 7 Lqos much beyond the normal level of dry-season fighting. 8 4. The Conunnists have not, for example, attempted to follow up on the recent government retreat from the Nain Bac 10 valley in northern Laos. We believe they are probably 11 interested primarily in reestablishing their presence in the 22 Se Done valley west of Saravane and, when they have stripped 13 out the area's rice stocks to support thei-r Vietnam-oriented 14 builcdLU in the infiltration corridor and i.n northern South 15 Vietna.:J, will probably relax their pressure on the town. 16 It if- ent.irely possible that the Laotians 7rill ha!e deserted 17 Sar'avan. by that time, however, and that the city will come 18 at le.lt t.emporarlly under enemy control. 119 5. Current anti-government activity by insurgents in 20 Thailand may be viewed in Hanoi as helpful in deterring 21 fuller US or Thai cormitments in Vietnam. There is little 22 evidence, however, that suffidient Com.unlst assets are 23 presently in place there to pose much more t.a. a contributing 24 terrorist threat to Thai security forces cr the US air bases, 25 assuming that the insurgeftts were ordered ntc. an all-out 26 effort. by flanc-1 and/or Peking. 27 E.

F. ASS.SSr-RN" OF FUTURE THREAT FROM NORTH VIETNAM 10 1. There have been many indications in recent weeks that 11 the North Vietnamese may now plan to use their limited air 12 arm in an offensive and/or logistic role to support the war -13 in South Vietnam. Bomber and transport activity by Hanoi's 14 air' force has increased in rectent weeks. Both AN-2 and IL-14 15 3 aircraft have carried out paradrops in northwestern &outh 16 Vietnam ai.d probably Laos, and IL-14s apparently attempted at 17 least one abortive bombing mission somewhere in the DMZ/ 18 Quang TrJ Province sector. A few of Hanoi's IL-28 bombers 19 hpve been act4,ve over North Vietnam for the first time in 20 / over two years. 21 ..2. During the past two weeks there have been indications 22 that another move of North Vietnamese manpower to South 23 Vietnam probably is underway. At least battalion-size and 24 regim-ntal-size elements are believed involved. There are 25 tenuous indications that "some of the infiltration may funnel 26 through the A Shau valley in northern South Vietnam. Units 27 coming in via this route have usually filled up or augmented 28 ComM.unlst forces in the northern provinces of the country. 29 3. Evidence of recent NVA activity, ho3 C r, d,es CY - LYDUN BAINES JOWSON LIBRARY suggest that any plan for an all-out Invas )n Is r-,irrently 31 being implemented.

Rather, 9 the level seem; designed more to support sustained military 10 operations by the forces now in place in the area. .11 4. Other evidence on the state of affairs within the NVN 12 including the regime's domestic propaganda pitch, covert 13 reporting on popular attitudes and activities, and the posture 14 of Chinese military and logistic units within and near North 15 Vetna.,,, also appear "normal" for the current wartime situ- 16 ation and do not suggest that any all-out push is coming. 17 In fact, regime propaganda in the wake of the Tet offensive 18 is again stressing the protracted nature of the conflict as 19 if to prepare the people for a long road of sacrifice ahead. 20 3 G. ENEMrTY CAPABILITIES IN CAMBODIA 21 1. The enemy presence in Cambodia is fluid and no assess- 22 ment of the current threat from area can be drawn. Never- 23 theless, it is probable that some units now threatening the 24 friendly forces in the central highlahds area are actually 25 located, ri,Cambodia or may maneuver through Cambodia against 26 targets in South Vietnam" 27 2.
