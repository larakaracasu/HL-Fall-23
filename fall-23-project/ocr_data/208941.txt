Laos, Probable Developments in [the trend in Lao affairs has been in the direction of a negotiated settlement that would involve at least partial integration of Pathet Lao troops into the army, formation of a coalition govt., and legalization of PL political activity. This trend toward negotiated settlement has been accompanied by a policy of neutrality which has been headed in the direction of eventual relations with the Communist bloc. A combination of Western pressure and Communist miscalculation, however, has brought PL-Royal govt. negotiations to a halt and caused the resignation of the Souvanna Phouma govt. A resolution of this crisis will determine whether the earlier tendency to accept PL conditions will be resumed or whether the govt. will take a stronger stand. In any case, the longer the hiatus continues, the greater will be the likelihood that the PL will benefit in the long run. Agreements affecting the PL position, Royal govt. strengths and weaknesses, Communist objectives and tactics, and short-term prospects are reviewed].

S.d S 30CLUSIONS 1. The most important developments in Laos over the next few months ill center around the problem of the Comauist Pathet Iao movement MWch, since the ceasefire of August 1954, has occupied a privileged sanctuary in the northern rovlinces of Sam Hea and Phong Saly. The underlying trend in Lao affairs is in the direction of a negotiated settlement that would involve at least partial integration of Pathet Lao troops into the Royal Am7, formation of a coalition goverrmmt including Pathet Lao leaders, lerlization 'of Pathet,'ao political activity, and enlargement of the National Assembly through elections in which the Comunists would be perrrdtted to participate. 2. Under Comunist pressure, the drift toward a negotiated settle- mrient has been accompanied by an elaboration of Lao neutrality policy in the direction of eventual relations with the Communist bloc. Intermit- tent negotiations between the government and the Pathet Iao have been marked ry a series of government concessions in return for Pathet Lao promises that remain unfulfilled, 3. Tis paltern of drift was interrupted in the spring of 1957 w,hen a combination of 1-restern pressure (warning a"ainst the danger of accepting a coalition gover=ient) and of Comunist miscalculation (demanding that Laos accept Chinese Ccm=unist economic aid as a condtion =IRET WONI
~~IT or settlement) brought direct negotiations to a halt and in Yay caused the resignation of the Souvanna Pho=a government. At mid-year, Lao faced the passioility of a prolonfed nt crisis* 4. The resolution of the cabinet crisis will determine whether the earlier trend toal. a cceptance of Pathet lao conditions necessary to obtain a final a,7eement iill be resumed, or whether this course will be further intear'upted by a stronger stand on tha part of the goverrment. The prospects for retardinM the drift will be improved to the extent that the influence of Nationalist Party leader Katay Sasorith and Independent Party leader Phoui n cone over government policy is increased. 5. The longer the present hiatus continues, the Zreater will be the likelihood t-at thj Pathet Lao will benefit in the long run. A pro- longed crisis would also increase the chances that Prince Petsarath, Viceroy of Laos recently returned from an fl-year exile in Thailand, would becmae prime Lnister as the only strong leader on uhom all factions could agree. 6. Because the Comaunists are under no compulsion to yield their present position except for a political settlement which they calculate would bring greater long-term prospects of expanding their influence throughout laos, any negotiated settlement that may occur would probably work to their advantage. It is doubtful that the Lao are capable of preventing greater infiltration and subversion once Communist elements are integrated into the arry and permitted to operate lerally throughout the country. To the etent that Cor unist influence vithin the government SECRET ii
SECRET inczeases, the . ore rapid-iril be the trend toward "normalizationP of relations rith the major Communist powers and, perhaps, %ith North Vietnam. 7. Even assuming that a goverrment is formed within the near p future and that the basis for a settlement with the Pathet Lao is reached, it is uni.eV% that its concrete effects would be visible before the end of 1.957. Although some dramatic development hastening the hither- to slow evolution of lao policy is possible, it seems probable that the interveidnr month Till be marked by repeated moments of tension and decision which the lao t.dIi deal with, characteristically, by temporiza- i., tion and evasion of clear-cut, irrewocable decisions* i.

3- no. =MC T 791S IN LMOS A. The Pathet Lao Problem The most serious ch eg conronting the Lao nation is the problem of the Pathet Lao -- a residue of the Indocbina war and the agreements of the 1954 Geneva Conference that halted it. In addition to the domestic problem posed by the eodstence of the Cemmist-led Pathet Lao forces, and their retention of a privileged sanct y in the two northern provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Sa3y, the creation of the International Control Comm mission (Icc), and the direct support of the Pathet Iao by the Comunist bloc has meant that deve ants in Iaoe are influenced by the policies and activities of the major Comunist nations, of the piipal tiestern po.ers, and of India as chairman of the ICC. The Pathet Lao, denied official recognition as a goverent in the Gene a Agreements, has nevertheless been able, because of Go=indst bloc support, to establish toto fiction that it is a functioning regime in the base areas it contro7.s and to exact from the Lao Goerrnet a degree of recognition sufficient to permit it to engage in direct negotiation for the political settlement envisioned in the Geneva Agreemets. 1.

In !la'ch 1956, a new go nt ider Prie Sowma Phouma took office. The ensidn moths made it cler that Sou tomr,s cbef objective was to end the sputt civil w,, and that he vas prepared to mCm cumulatively suIbstantal comcessions to Co=nst dumands for the sake of' realizinZ a comprehensive aareement, Seuvaxma's efforts Wre abetted by the Conmiste wbo apparently sensed that a gov r under his leadarebip provided their best hope for achieving terms favorable to their objective of expanding their in- flueoe and control vithout undue risk of touching off new hostilities involvina outside powers. Led by Peiping, the Cmm=st nations Joined in hailing Souvanna's policy decl n (largely a reaffirtion of the previous rovulymultis pledge of neutrality and respect for the five 4 ~principl3es of co..e3dLteome) as a ftiif policy that'promised ijaoe3nt of the situation in Laos. At the end of Narch the Pathet Lao proposed new political neCotiations, sugsti tat the rentts internal and foreign policy ptf otii .=o4ided a nev basli -for negotia',. s. AXter a prolonged e=hange of c mications, involving dU vement as to the timing and locale for a persotw3 meetSng, a and the"Pathet Lao cief., So- UvWC met at VientLane,, on JWY Ao, 1956. In two co nque, ismed August 5 and 10,, the two leaders a omed
5 thel r agreement on the broad p.-Inciples of a political settlement. In the first, they asserted that all hostilities must cease and agreed that: 1) the Lao Govern o;ent would pursue a neutralopolicy, developing relations -ith allnations, particularly its neighbors, and eschewin-". alliances or establisieut of foreign military bases e=ept as provided in the coasofire agreements; 2) the Lao Gover-nent would -uarantee civil rights to all without discri.dnation; 3) "the question" of elections and a r-oa2ition government was still XzlAer study; 4) integration of the ino northern provinces would be accomplished by placing Patlet Lao addmistration and troops under authority of the 'ryal Goverzmzent; Â£ ) iz:ed political and militarxy cormissions would work out details. The secoad comaunique announced a7-eement that: 1) supplenentary Hational Assembly elections would be held (per- -tting the Pathet Lao to contest the additional seats); 2) a government of national unon would be formed ith Pathet Lao part-icipation; 3) the rL:ed coymitssions would meet irrithout delar to apply the agreements reached in principle. Although Souvanna had declared, at the end of the August meetings with SoWihanouvon,, that peace vas "restored," sporadic clashes between 1?CZ T
govermnent ard Comm, unist forces. occurred during August and September. On Ctober 31, the mi:ed military commission reached an agreement calling for a neir ceasefire, with A-mrI:ed subcormssions in each of the two disputed provinces to impler.ent the agreement. On November 2, the mixed political commission signed an agreement detailing te policy of neutrality :ich the lao Government would follow: 1) i=mnediate establishent of diplomatic relations with countries requesting it; 2) economic and cultural exchanges -vth such countries even in advance of diplomatic recognition; 3) acceptance of aid from all countries offering it uncon- 4) refusal to join ril4taa"y pacts or to permit establishment of ar7, foreig,n military bases e:cept as provided in the Geneva Agreements. Secret understandings provided that the terms of the agreement would become operative only when a full -political settlement vas reached and that provisions relating to recognition of Commuist China and the Comnunist reZime in north Vietnam, and to acceptance of additional forein aid, would be delayed. On December 22, Prime lnister So,-anna Phoua joined with Souphanouvong, who had returned to Vientiane in November fo" direct talks, in a new declaration that reviewed prior understandingrs and con- tained the new pledge (a concession b- Souvanna) thar, a coalition C1ET
S=IRET -7- government including the Pathet Lao would be formed prior to the .elections. The cabinet attached new conditions to protect the Royal Government's position, in effect disapproving this declaration. The mixed !'olitical .comission signed an agreement December 24 covering the manner of Pathet Lao integration into the civil administration and other aspects of civil rights for Pathet Iao members. On Decaber 23, the cabinet approved a revision of the December 22 declaration, giving government approval to Souvanna's program fQr sup- plecentary elections, for formation of a coalition in advance of the election subject to a confidence vote by the Assembly, for transfrmation* of the Pathet Lao. into a political party, and for placing the adinistra- tion and fighting forces of the Pathet lao under Royal Government ad- minisItation nimediately folloidnel formation of a coalition government. Soxvanna and Sovphanouvong for-drded this declaration to the ICC. On Febrry 2,. the political ccmission concluded an agreement on the electoral law to .govern anry supplementary elections, the details of. which are not. Imown. Despite the considerable duplication, these several agreements and declarations tend to obscure the procrastination and delays involved in the inter-ttent negotiations between the two sides. Souphanouvrong has been unable to agree to substantive propositions iithout reference to his headquarters in Sam Neua, reflecting, probabl,,. both internal divisions withiL the Pathet Lao on. the question of proper tactics in SS ET
-8- dea i.ng with the Boyal Government and the Pathet Lao's dependence on Hanoi and Piping for gidanae and support. The Royal Government, on its side, has been subjected to varying pressures, from Lao politicians who favored either .nore e!-te.nsive concessions for the sace of agreement or greater caution lest essential guarantees be lost; from the ICC, particularly India, sterng krom concern lest outright failure of negotiations lead to rene.zal of fighting on a larger scale; and from the Westerm powers, particularly the US and Bitain, varning of the dangers inh6rent in the Comiunist atterpt to gain legitimacy and political recognition. Negotia- tions have been embarrassed by periodic cutbreaks of sma1l-scale fight- ing, .for which both sides appear to share responsibility, and the general drft tniard a settlement has been affected by a series of external events. In June 1956, the USR and Poland made overtures to Laos looking toward diplomatic recognition and an e=change of missions. The Lao Goveniment ac:1o1ledged Soviet recognition without, at the tire, taking any action on its oun part, but an exchange of missions had beer :accepted by the .cabipt when the Hungarian uprising gave the Lao second thoughts.: and caused postponement of ary action. At the end of -ay 1956, Chinese Communist Premier Chou En-lai extended an.invitation via Indian representatives to Souvanna to visit Peiping. Souvannas acceptance was stated to be conditional on prior "settlement" of the Pathet Lao problem, but with momentum, developing following public Iknowledge of the invitation, Souvanna chose to consider MCRET
-9- that ihe August c mamunlques announcing agreement "in principle" con- stitited a settlement. A government delegation visited Cmunist ChinA for 10 days at the end of August, stopping briefly and inforally in Hanoi on its return. During his Peiping visit, Souv a repeated previous pledges to refrain from entering military alliances and to observe the "five prin- ciples," and agreed with Chou En-lai that the two countries would develop their economic and cultural relations. Souvanna appears not to have follca.ed up a Chinese Comimist offer to discuss economic aid, and the Peiping regine did not press the issue of recognition. In addition to a ,eneral declaration on development of friendship through econcmic and cultural relations, the lao visit to Hanoi resulted in an agreement to formi a joint comission to investigate a border dis- pute in the area of Nong Het. The Vietnamese Comunists subsequently attem.pted, without success, to use this cmmssion to develop direct intergovernmental negotiations. Along with these Comunist pressures, the Lao Government -vas made awre, through the year of negotiation, of Nestern interest in the preserva- tion of the integrity of Laos and the fears of the lestern powers that the concessions sought by the Communists as the price of agreement would create a dangerous vulfierability to further Communist inroads. In Septerber 1956, Cro%m Prince Savang visited the US and ias assured by the Secretary of State that Iaos could count on continued SM.U,I win
-10- support "so long as that support goes to a government vigorously seeking to maintain its oun independence." In November the US officially warned tie Lao that such contingent developments as organization of a coalition government, integratibn "of Pathet Lao forces at the risk of iperil4 the integrity of the Lao army, or acceptance of aid frn Commuiist countries might force a reappraisal of US political and economic policy toward Laos. Later in the mionth, the US tw'ned aside a request by Souvanna that the US support a settlement in -which the Pathet Lao received two or three cabiaet poats. Deptity Prime iZnexter Katay visited tIasbi_gton in DecemNer, and uas given asirances comparable to these earlier statements that US- support would coni-nue, but on the assumption that Lao actions did not create a threat to the futare independence and integrity of the country. On Februar 22, Souvanna Phouma had requested that the US, France, a:d the UK provide a statement of their policy tonard Laos. It is not clear wimther Souvanma s intent was to buttress his own position against Pathet Lao demands by demonstrating Western support, or to talm advantage of differences in outlook arong the three states to justify his policy of continuin_g to seek areement by negotiation, even at the cost of ad- ditional comcessions. On April 16, the three pouers replied to Souranna in separate parallel notes. The US note confirmed interest in the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Laos and repeated support for the pri,ciple of R oyal Government authority throughout the country. The note expressed hope for a political SWIM,T
I: I oaettlenent consistent ith the Geneva Agreements and the IMCIs January 7, 1956 resolition (which reaffirmed Royal Goverment sovereignty over the disputed provinces), and noted that achievement oZ this objective had been obstructed by t1. introduction of "fe:traneous conditions" by the ilathet lao c 2. Crisis in tIe _ S Lsr of 1957. Although events are apt to move slo-aly In Laos, it is apparent that Souvanna failed to adhere to his own timetable for a settlement ith the ?athet Lao. The .absence of a firm settlement and the spoadic :'enenal oZ fighting in the disputed provinces increased pressure on his government. This pressure vas greatly intensi- fied when, in Febru>r, the Patet Lao proposed as a nev, additional condition of the overall set-' .ment, that Laos agree to accept Chinese Comimuist ecorolic ald This dernm brought'hme to an increased number of Lao leaders the ultimate control of the Pathet Lao by foreigrn Communist parties, and aroused Vreater opposition to firthe.r concessions for the sake of early agreement. Even tough the Pathet Lao subsequent4ry withdru this demand, at least for the time being, it is likely that its*action in advancing the aid proposal contributed more heavily thUn any other single factor to the failure to achieve, thus far, a settlement they themiselves seemdto -ant and which, over the long term, would probabl y have worked to their ad- vantage. MCRET J
dip12 - Mhe National Assembly adjourned on March 35 vithout having, voted on Souannals program, for settlement based on the December 28 agrement. When the Assembl reconvewd Nay 11, Souvanna again sought support for continued negotiarCiois. In voting on Ilay 29, the Assemb2y approved the agreements already enteed into with the Pathet Lao, but failed to approve a resolution favoring continued neZotiations in line uith Souvanna's expressed policy,. The adverse vote resulted fram the combined weight of the leftist ational Union Party of Bong Souvannavong, which favored more concessions for ithe sake od igreement, and of conservative deputies in the Independent Party and Souvanna's on iationalist Part. who advocated greater caution and demanded firmer guarantees by the Pathet Lao that its promises would be fulfilled. Although the votes uTere ostensibly adrisory rather than an issue of confidence, Souvanna! s goverrment resigned, touching off a government. c.isis that, at mid-year, remained unresolved. The Communist position remains that: 1) the Royal Government must be broadened by formation of a coalition inclding all parties (i.e., not only the Pathet Lao but also, Bong's leftist National Union Party), but with the number and identity of the cabinet seats the Pathet Lao would finally demand uncertain; 2) supplementary elections for the Hational Assembly must be held in which the Pathet Lao (or its political front., the Heo Lao Hac Xat) could cmpete as a recognized political party; SMIET
-13 - 3) Pathet Lao troops (in unspecified numbers) must be integrated into the loyal Arr.7; 4) Pathet Lao civilian officials must be given appropriate (though unmnomi) positions in the royal admlinistration of the two disputed provinces; 5) Laos must adhere to a "correct" policy of neutrality and friendsbin with all nations., presumably inplying acceptance of aid frcm Conunist nations at sRe date. In the absence of a responsible government, the Lao position is uncer'tain, but involves a general insistence that agreement on a coalition -overnment and supplementary elections must be contingent on immediate restoration of effectiv goveriment a&dnistration in the northern provLnces and on liitation of the nuber of Pathet Lao effectives in- teLrated into the Royal Ar. to a point that vrill not jeopardize its loyalty to the Crovm. There has been no agreement, in the mi:&ed comissions or beU-een top leaders, on the iechanics by which these vital aspects of the settle- ment would be carried out. =RT
SECRLT -14- Bo 'I,,al Gover:eat: 3-trangths and l'akesses 1. PolitialcPersonalitiesand.Al_.rets. The monarchy represents pn element af stability. -anc. basic unity in Laos, even though its ininuence must be e:,ercised indirectly because of the nature of the constitutional system. With the aCing I'ing Sisavong Vong virtually inactive, the interests of the roarl family are upheld by Crown Prince Savang. His long-tiae affec- tion for the Frencla has been something of a political liability, but his friendship for the c-est and. concern lest the government bargain away its birthright Ln the search for an i2lusory agreement with the Cmmunists have servcd, to --etcrd -the drift to%rd an -ccoodation to pathet Lao pr3ssures. The civil goverrent., both the cabinet and assembly, operates for the Most part on*a plane separated,fi!o the rass of the people by the latterls indifferenc. and lack of political sophistication. Except on the broadest issues, perhaps of War and peace, the government enJoys a 6egyree of flbility that may frequently prove an element of strength. On the other hand, the desperate thinness of the elite group fit is virtual- ly impossible to form a competent cabinet uithout eraring a substantial iiwilter of Ia' st.ers from the ranks o.,' the Assariy), creates instability I ste=ming from rivalry anong key individuals. As in so :aany of the ne-V7y independent Asian countries, the political parties in the Assembly represent the personal followings of key leaders more than groups identifiable because of discernible ideological diffCrences. 'fith no party having a sure majority in the present Assembly, control of the governaent must rest on working
SEawT -15- agreements among individual leaders and families, which require concessions to achieve and are not apt to be durable. .The djxiant Nationalist Party, which nominally controls 21 of the 39 seats in the Assembly, is divided among factions led by Souvanna Phouma and by Katay Sasorith. In addition, several Nationalist Party deputies have frequently voted independently-. U'hUen working in harmony, it is the nearest approach to a national party, as Katwy represents southern elements and Souvaiina derives his support primarily from the northern area formerly comp Ising the Kingetom of Luang Prabang. In addition to their differences -ith respect to such current issues as the nature of an acceptable settle- ment with the Pathet Lao, the two cannot escape the heritage of regionalism that rermins an iportant political element in Laos. Katay's southern origin has recently led to allegations of involvement with the former Prince of Champassalk, Boun Oum, in separatist plotting. (Natay's reputation for close rapport iith the US may be partly responsible, therefore, for other recent rum.ors that the US is supporting separatist agitation, spread by malevolent LiUdividuals including, to judge from indirect evidence, some krench officials.) The Independent Party led by Phoui Sananikone, which holds eight seats in th6 present Assembly, is largely representative of the important Sananil:one family. The Democratic Party, -Ulhich has four seats, is little more than a political instrument of the V oravong clan. The Voravongs't distrust of Phoui, stemming from charges of his complicity in the 1954 assassination of then Defense Minister Kou Voravong, was in large measure responsible for Katay's inability in June 1957 to form a government in coalition with Phoui. SE MET
M.ECRIM -16- The National Union Party of Bor Souvannavong fomaly has three seats in the Assembly but usually camands support frm soe of the unaffiliated deputies. Bong, whose activities are unencumbered by ad- herence to political principles other than that of expediency, has been an effectie spo:cesmdn thin parl.iwnt for the Pathet Lao 1.ne on "unit.4 and "reconciliation" in recent months. A nell uncertainty has been added to the political scene by the recent return from Thailand of Prince Petsarath, half-brother to both Souvarua Phouma and Pathet Lao leader Soupunouvong, and senior represent- ativo of the junior or "cadet" branch of the Lao ruling family. His return in :larch, after an U1-year erile, is SymptO.Matic of the same com- pulsion toward a reunification of all Lao elements, after the period of resistance to French rule, that induces tie drift toward settlement with the Communist Pathet Lao. Although 2etsarath's restored title of Viceroy is supposed to be non-hereditary, tke royal family, or at least the Crown Prince, remains fearful of petsarathts influence and of possible efforts to replace the present ruling fa:rily installed by the French in 1946. Xatay and other political leaders are concerned lest a reunion of the three half-brothers lead to strong political dauimation of the country by their family. Despite his relatively advanced age (67), Petsarath is active and vigorous. He is one of the most able executives and most dynamic leaders Laos has produced, and it seems inevitable that he irill again play a iiportant role. He seems to have retained considerable residual popularity through his long period of exile, based, presumably, on his noble birth SECRET
'T - 17 - and on his early leadership of the Froe Lao movemmnt for inrome ron *ance. Since his return to Laos, Petsarath has oxpresed his conviction that national retunification is possible (Ibut has avoided suggestine specific formulae), has approv'ed neutrality as the croct policy for Laos (indicatew ing in private conversations that this wo-Ad involve relations with Comunist ,.hina even wile retaining US aid, provided the latter can be adjuste%, to Sive more crmiasis to economic aesistance and less to military aid), :Ld 1a: boen busy travelinC through the country renewing acquaint- ances arnc Lee!-ia:, to learn cond4.tions first-hand. R.eportecz,r he ias Ln-- pressed by wh,.t he considered tie aministrative effectiveness of the Pathet La3 in the "o=uunist areas he visited and has expressed doubts that the majority of Pathet Lao adherents are Comiunists. On the basis of vritings attributed to him during his sta. in Thailand, he seems to have a rather heaoa realism in his approach to basic Lao economic problems - which torether with his proven a6inistrative abilities mi-3ht be good for the futur dve1o.zLnt o tie coizitry - but 'ais relationship with his .half-b&other. aaC -W policy recommendations ie uill reach when his toL-- d'horizon is conplete are unce-rta.n. In ad-lition to the general problem o: the scarcity of sUilled leadership, 1,aos suffers from political ills not uncamon to other countries of the region. 1.ar*- of the 1ey leaders are heavily involved in economic enterprises (Xatay and Bong being notable exav!es), and graft and corrup- tion are continraing probles., The civil a&iinistration suffers from personnel shortages, the rudimentar-y transportation and cormunication SEQ7T

U3 observers believe that the RIoyal Army is capable of preventing a rajor erive by the Pathet Lao out of this privileged sanctu- ary; that the aru,y could by offensive action seize control of major toums and other stzateii points within the Pathet Lao areas but is mlikely to do so for -ar that the Vietnamese Cmvunists would intervene in suppct of the Pathet Lao; and that the Royal Army uould probably be incapable of completely elminating Pathet Lao dissidence, given the advantages gurril- la forces enjoy because of diff !cVt terrain and proximity of Vietnamese military bases in northmst TonLIj6

The army is scattered, with considerablo n=,wtors at re:aota posts, sa-.,e of which are completely depe4ident on air supply and vulnerable to Pathet Lao harass:nent. Although no tabuiailiqn-is possible, it sefums lUely..that desertions have been about as. nu;-erous fP-om the Royal ArWmy as fro&4 the Pathet Lao forces - Irith the significant difference that Royal Army deserters have usually simply re- tl-=ned to their villages, ihereas those Pathet Lao desertions that are known have been defections to the 1oyal Government, The govermiient has organized villagc self-defense units in areas of the two northern provinces that are norinally under its control. These uits have apparently had so:ne siccess in rotaining the loyalty of the "ocal populatioa on the side of the legitimate government. Ilore j.ecently, the goverrmient has been developLnr plqns for a civic action proram cinj; scci'ity, information, and village self-help functions, and has oponcd a training center for tca=- that will work in remote areas. Althoch Coim-uist stranetl is concentrated in the areas of Sam Ieua and PhonL Sal.r Provices contwolled by Pathet Lao troops, Vietnamese as ...ell as Lao Communist cadres have bcen operating in other parts of Laos, a-itating for stport of the idea of peaceful settlement and a coalition government, and denouncing those Lao leaJers who have advocated continuing ties with the !est. 1eports Ln recent months suggest an increase in the activity of these groups and an enlargement of the areas they infect, but it is not certa . whether this trend is sigificant or largely a reflection of im.proved coverage in the reports received. Outside of the two northern SEM-T
- 20 - pA'ovinces, the prj.ncipal areas of Cor-mudst activity appear to be in Vientiane Province, in areas adjacent to the 'ickong River toims of Thakhe.. and Pakse, and along the Lao-Vietnam border. There have been reports of zawall armed groups, in addition to political organizers and propaganda cadres, operating in areas where government administration and police control are ineffective. Despite efforts to improve the internal security profiam (including the training of soe Lao police personnel in Thailand), the government renains incapable of suppressing subversive activity in all parts of the country ,t the same time. C. The CoiurO-st Position 1. Objective and Tactics. Laos is probably an example of the type of country i. which an open Corunist rebellion is less dangerous to the integrity of the nation than an essentially political campaign of infiltra- tion and s,version. Fmr Lao are sufficiently sophisticated and educated to understan. the natiare of the Communist problem Ln terms of its world-ide drive for political domuiation. The prevailing tendency has been to inter- pret the Pathet Lao problem as a matter of the reiuion of the Lao people. While the Pathet Lao ,-as in open rebellion, the source of the threat to constituted authority ias obvious, aic. resistance by the Iloyal Government w.as conceCed to be L.aperative. iven those few inc'ividuals who are cognizant of the Co.urist connections of' the Pathet Lao leaders and the movazntl sub- scrvience to international Comunism have .ound it -ore difficult to cope vith an cqually formidable threat conin, in the guise of profeered friend- ship and reconciliation reinforced, from Corranist China and Comunist S73T
- 21 - north Vietnam by offek,s of assistance and rpapect for the integrity and independence of Laos. For this reason, the shift in Communist tactics to emphasis on offers of a negotiated settlement, particularly since the istallation of the Souvanna Photma Government in the sping of 1956, seems likely to promote the endwing objective of gaining control throughout Laos more effectively than Cie carlier concent-ation on violence. In the long history of the intermittent ne&otiatic,s leading to the hiatus in the second quarter of 1957, th-q Pathet Lao leadership (presumably under-guidance from Hanoi and/or Peiping) has worked skillfully to enAarge the concessions tendered by the Royal Government as the price of agreement without finally giving away any Cna-muist .assets. In the net, the Pathet Lao position remains essentially as it was in the spring of 1917%5; no territory has been lost, no armed forces disbanded, and there has been no apparent slackening in the propaganda and indoctrina- tion efort directed either at the controlled population in the northern provinces or tard the people of the remaining D:-ovinces. On the other hand, the government has agreed, successively, to integrate Pathet Lao troops into the Royal An, and grant positions in the civil administration to Pathet Lao.nctionaries; to legitimize the PatLet Lao political front as a bona fie.e political party; to schedule supf-e m.entary elections for an enlarged iational ;.ssembly pe.iitting Pathet Lao participation; and to form a coalition gorerinent including Pathet Lao representatives -- apparently without regard to whatever popular followig it ;ay be able to demonstrate at the polls. In addition, Souvanna Phouma p.eUged his government to a
22 - foreiga policy couched Li tarns of frien..Ly relations and the acceptance of aid from. "all comtries' in -eneral terms which will provide continuing opportidties foi tie Pathet Lao to agitate for further modifications favora7le to Lrcatar external Cour,ist influence. The principal'ndgotiating tactic has been to imply, at every stage, that final agreement required on.y one more gestur'e or concession by the Royal Government, and then, vith the appetite for final settlement whetted, to introduce one further obstacle iihich has had to be settled before the special car.iss-i.ons and subcomUis- sions can deal effectively ith the "details" oi impleentation. This web continued to groW until, in February 1957, the Pathet Lao lecaders overreached themselves by demanding Royal Government acceptance of Chinese Co=.,iunist aid, thus halting, at least temporarily, the goerwient s aaco.iodation. 2. Thc Ccr-=:i-3t Assets a, The desirc for national tw.ty. Per-haps the most important single Co;nist assot is the strong motivation of most Lao leaders for an end to the civil war. A reconciliation would establish Laos in full sovereignty for the first ti,We within its present borders. It ould re- assure leaders of the viability of a society badly fragmented by ethnic divisions and poaochIal iterests. Luring the period of Souvannats government, this urge to unity assumed an almost imstic quality which at times beclouded tha larger issues and induced a willingnoss to accept dangcero-s ris:s Ln agreeing to Pat'et Lao dozands. But the desire to end the i.ar is not confined to the small elite. Each time the National Assembly has convened, the deputies have returned to the capital from SLET
- 23 -- their home districts impressed with the Lv, orlance of reaching a settlement. This reaction reportedly stems from the fact that few ?ao vlages lack con- tact Tuith the fighting in the north through some soldier who has returned home wounCed or zaLrLec., chiefly from mines with -hich the Communists have littered the jiuigle trails. The resulting deAand for an end to what is considerod a civil war is perhaps the only zanifestation of an effective natiom:ide ppublic opinion. b. Fear of Communist ChLna. Thosc Lao leaders who appreciate the dependence of the Fathst Lao on outside Cm.munist support and the local Cor.mi st subservience to e:ternal direction -have come to believe that the best hope of isulatbiC Laos against such intervention is to de- prive the ChInese and Vietnamese Cc-ma sts of their local instruments - through reabsorption of the Pathet Lao into the "national community." Souvanma Phoina has perhaps been 1oremost arong those leaders nho have alll,ed theiaselves to believe that, i7hatcver their oresent Comunist lean- ings, the Pathet Lao "Lea-lers are Lao first and Corrmunists second, and that once detach-d from dpandence on foreign support, they would become reoriented touard"- Lao n,.t.ona2 interests. "The United States m,ay -emain active in Asia, and continue to help us for 10, 20, or 50 years. But China i.11 always be our neighbor." This rationalization. for a policy decicated to the search for peace2ul coeoxistence with Communist China has been heard vith increasing frequency by US represontativcs, Irom a variety of Lao Icaders, in rasponse to i-arnings of the dangerous consequences of further concessions to Pathet Lao demands.
SEET -24- c. The base- areas. Pathet Lao control over large parts of the two provincas of Sam Neua and Phong Saly is another important asset, not least as a bargaining point in negotiations with the government. The latent threat of Chinese or Vietnamese Communist intervention has probably been prLarily responsible for deterring any Royal Government effort to dislodge the Cormunists by force. In addition, the presence of the ICC (despite its reaffirmation on January 7, 1956 of the Royal Government's sovercignty ovor the disputed provinces by terms of the Geneva Accords) has been a barrier to any attempt to reach the "final settlement" envisaged at Geneva by other than peaceful means. The Pathet Lao armed forces, estimated to total about 6,000, are the basis of the strength of the Pathet Lao movement. Although continuing defections from the Pathet Lao indicate the existence of morale problems, they may be no more serious for Commurist commanders than for the Royal Government. In addition to supplies received from norwth Vietnam, the Pathet Lao is supported by Vietnamese technicians and, probably, by political cadres. In the fall of 1956, it was reported that many of the Vietnamese advisors, and most heavy equipment, .mre being 1ithdrawn to Vietnam, ap- parently anticipating a settlement. More recently, there have been indica- tions that suppl)ies and scwie Vietnamese a&risors are again moving Lto Laos. Reports frorm Lao army sources that regular Vietnamese Communist army units are in Laos lack confirmation, altough it would be quite possible for the Vietnamese Communists to mobilize units consisting of minority groups that would be indistinguishable from inhabitants cf Laos. SE CUT
IMICRET -25 The de.7ea of pbpular support for the Coirunist movement in the tu.,o northern provinces is uncertain, in the Zace of conflicting reports. Some observers have spoken of the apparent efficiency of the Pathet Lao administrative apparatus, of the fact that schools are running, and of observable ent suslasxa'adong the people. It seems likely, however, that such observations relate primarily to the principal. tcrims under Comaunist control.' It is reported, further, tiat the Pathet Lao has used special care in its approach to non-Lao peoples, attempting to avoid harsh treat- ment in hopes of stimulating greater support and intensifying the dissident problem faced by the*Rcyal Government. On t e other hand, I oyal Arm- units and village self-defense groups ! operating in the no.--thern provinces have usually been favorably received by the local population; there are reports of resentment over Pathet Lao oprtn ntenotenpoicshaeuulybe fvrbyrcie P orced rocruiting, requisitioning of supplies, and labor levies among the northern people. It seems doubtful that the Pathet Lao has been able to accomplish more than a superficial indoctrination of the general population in. the controlled areas or that it enjoys positive support from the majority of the people. d. The stbvcrsive network. Although Coziu.unist strength in Laos is centered in those parts of Phong Saly and San Neua provinces from which Pathet Lao forces have excluded government adrdnistrative officials and of the country. The network appears to consist mainly of small mobile *-roups, sometimes armed, engaged prirarily in contact and indoo-trination i:or1t.

Since it is usually L-apossible to -e.l when different reports may refer to the activities of the sme group, it is lil:ely t1at the volw.e of %.eeports creates a misleading :Uipression of the scope of Co.uunist activity. Because the subversive elewelits are i(:bile, it is also likely that the Lao Government and people also orIe-.ive an exag,erated sense of the extent o: Communist activity. Such ma impression may havrc serious operational consequences. .t is not possible to Cescribe the size, ustrbution, or coordinat- ing mechanism of the Coizunist apparatus. As noted previously, Pathet Lao ca,res seem to be most active, outside 'of the tuo northern provinces, in the rural a.ea surrounding the capital of Vientiane, in the southern provinces, ard alo?'g the Victnam border. In addition, Ccmunist cadres a:aon- the Vietnama,se minority (with apparently some support or guidace fro. tl', Viatn&'.se refuee group in Thailaid), m.d arong the overseas Ch'Â±-.esc, .epes nt inuorta.t sbversve nucei hch could be more effective- Iy coordJ.A ec! ;ith Pat.et Lao activities than Li fact appears to have been the case th,z far.

SECRET 27 - II. SHORT-7F4 rROSPCTS A. Nature and Consequences of a 'ossible Settlement with the Pathet Lao The remainder of 1957 is likely to be a period of uncertainty in Laos, -ith the problem of a setlert.ent with the Pathct Lao causing rect-rring periods of tension and alternaing lulls. * Lookirg back over the c'ianges of the past 15 months, the sequence of deve!opmnts .appears to have been agorizing!y slow, and even Lao leade s ?rooably had expectations that progress toward a settlement would take -pacc more rapidly. Nevertheless, the pace of life in Laos, politi- cally, as well as othertvise, is normally slow, and the Lao have a basic predisposition to temporize rather than to seek sharp, definitive, and perhaps i:'revocable decisions. For that reason, it is not at all im- possible tha-, the next half year will see no dramatic denouement to the 2oag-drar.. out effoits toward a peaceful settlement. Bvun if the.Le sho-Id be an overall agreement between the Pathet La and -htever Royal Government emerges from the June cabinet crisis, it see-,s nrobable Uiat thc rest of the year would be spent in taking the basic zteps :iecessary to irplesient it, so that no far-reaching conse- ou,nces wotld be measurable by that time. Aliowing for variation depending on the comp)sition and orientatioii ol the new govermexrt, it seo..x probable tha the inivial step wculd be the formation of a coalition "goverraent of national union." 'This stage could take several weeks even after Azscmbly approv:2 of the primcipl. of a coalition, in view of the jockeying that ;ould take place for the n=iber and identity of cabinet SECIET

Tbis negotiating stag,e cannot be launched until a new Royal Government is installed and prcsumably, secures Assembly approval for any specific coa.li ion proposal-* Me second ;ajor stage, on the basis of the tentative agreements 'eached betwlecn Souvanna Phouma and the Pathet Lao, u'ould probably be the sunilem,entany National A,sembly elections. It is most unlikely that any steps towar%. such an action iili be talcen before the end of the rainy season (in Sertember or October). The government has not determined precisely the manner of &.llocation of additional seats nor have arrange- ments for the registration of women (enfranchised in a 1956 constitutional revision) beNn =-de. Allowing for a period of campaigning, elections would be unlikely before Kovember, so that it would be about the end of the year before the new Assembly could be convened and organized. It serS predictable that the Pathet Lao will not proceed with the dismantling of its a&,inistrative apparatus or the integration of its milit,ry forces uitil it feels assued that these prior conditions (coalition government and Assembly elections) have been met. it is likely, therefore, it T.ili be the end of the year before a critical test of Pat,et Lao willingness to carry tlrough an agreed political settlement would be reached. ?iis highly tentative timetable further assumes optimum cond.tions conducive to such a 'settlement. A :-iar6inal possibility would be a more dramatic and more sudden settlement, arising out of a prolonged governmental crisis and the SECPMT

Pathet Lao might find advantages in pressing rapidly forward with measures to :Laplament the agreement, assuming that whatever advantages wouid be lost t1irbuch dissolution of its anied forces woild be more than matched by the political influence gained by virtue of accession to the settle;ilent. There is no evidence currently available to sug. est that such a development is likely. The nature of any settlement reached would be conditioned by the composition of the Royal Govenuent tha% conclnded it. in general, however, there is unlikely to be any settlelent on terms less favorable to the Pathet Lao t,ia those alreadl, accepted in principle by Souvanna Phouma, Although a reversion to large-scale open warfare by the Comunists rould probably obstrhct Co', ;nist efforts in other parts of Southeast Asia and therefore be avoided, the Pathet Lao is unlikely to lose significantly by continua- tion of% the stalemate, 7-Thatever additional disaffection developed tithin its a ranics would probably be counterbalanced by growing divisions among the non-Cormaunist parties in the Assembly and in the government. The ,4widening of existing schisms would tend to work to the Communists' advantage over the long run. In general, a government headed by either Katay or Phoui uould probably be less inclined to entertain a proposal for substantial further concessions to the Pathet Lao than one formed either by Souvanna Phouma or by such less likely prime ministerial choices as Viceroy Petsarath or SEP?

He is accustomed to t.e exei.cise of power and before 16n he may feel i.npelled to play a rnore active role than his somei.ihat vague position as Viceroy affords. Daring the tenure of the last govermient, some Lao observers felt that he was the only person capable of achieving a settlement of the Pathet Lao problem, by mediating between his half-brothers Souphanoavo.i and Souvanna Phouma, and Petsarath iway himself share that belief. The pojicies which he i-muld follow,, should hc achieve a position of pouer, arc not clearly defined. -e choice of governn:ent leaders, as well as the specific policies they purs.,, will probably be determned chiefly by the estimate of Lao political lsaders of the chances of preveating a renewal of large-scale fighting and acl-lievin a final political settlement with the Pathet Lao. Basic economic -robleA.s are important and have recently become the subject of increasi.ng discussion anonG political leaders. However, economic conditions and prublems are unlikely to be important deteninnants of the success or failure of governmeats during the poeriod of this estimate. SECTXT

SIRET - 37 - by inclision of the Pathet Lao in a coalition governmntv and the Lao have aleaLy been put on no-tl'ce that such a development uOuld force a reappraisal oi US policy, includi.g aid programs. The dependence of Laos on exterral aid is so great that any major chan(e in -re.ent p;ograms would probably have an unsetciing effect. The morale of military leaders would undoubtedly be adversely affected by a significanv reduction in militaiy aid. A reduction in econoric aid would cause concern to those involved in the corr-.erciPl import program and to governiient leaders who believe that popular support for thc Zoveam- en , rcouires visible results beneficial to the population as well as condrcive to eventual economic developmento Regardless of any objective deteriration With respect to program effectiveness or efficiency, any reduction or major change in the US aid pro,ram made against Lao wishes vould nrobabl," be interpreted as a slackening of US interest. Sach a -caction would have in.portant consequences fcr Lao inter- national behavior. Despite rrofessed neutrality and the tendency to slide tow-ard rccoaciliaion with the Pathet Lau and toward establishment of relations with the Co:nmnist bloc, the ,-iajority of present Lao leadeis seem, to value tle assurances implicit in US assistance programs. It is li:ely that thay also find soiae reassurance in the potential pro"ection afforded by the inclusion of Laos in the a:ea covered by the SATO Protocol, despite the goverirent's uruilling-ness to identify itself ope.nly with SAXO. T,is ambivalent attitude toward SEATO reflects not only the stipulation of the Geneva Agreements bazning participation i,- military alliances, but SECIT

Emergence of a belief that US interest 6n Southeast Asia and specifically in laos was diminishing would tend to have the effect of accelerating the +'end toward relations with bloc countries. ,klthoigh constitutional revisions in 1956 deleted all reference to Wht French Uni.on, Laos has continued to participate in the Council of the Union, and rctains thc closest relations with FrOnce of any of the three for-e.B Indochina States. The personal orientation of the Croim Prince and the -ac- tiat French administration never bore as heavily or as directly on t'e Lao account in :Lar-e part for this situation. T.he maintenance o& the Frnch militar-y base at Seno, provided for in the Geneva A.--ee;aen*s, haj caused friction from time to time, but thz Lao have not requested its removal and seem unlikely to do so unless Communist influence in thc Covernment should develop. French policy has supported Souvama i oura's ef forts to reach agreerient with the Pathet Lao un- reservedlv in rec3nt months, causi:Ae some difficulty in relations with the US and t%e 717. And the personal behavior of the incumbent French lobassado-. receitl,r has ruffled Lao feelings. hevertLeless, it is likely that the Lao Covernu.e!nt, bariin the emergeiice of signiZicant Pathet Lao influence, will continue tc have friendl%- relations with France ard that French advisors will continue to exert appreciable influence on important Lao o"ficials.
