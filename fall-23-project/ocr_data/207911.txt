[Guided missiles] Program for Deployment of NIKE ZEUS [because Nike Zeus will not provide effective defense for soft targets against large-scale or decoyed missile attacks, reasons other than technical must support a decision to deploy the system. Among these are the possibilities that the Soviets will make errors in their ICBM design, that the system will introduce a larger degree of uncertainty into Soviet decision-making, that the Soviets will have to earmark a segment of their ICBM force to suppress Nike Zeus, that the system will inhibit blackmail by secondary nuclear powers, that the system will counter future Soviet claims to the deployment of a successful anti-missile system, and that the deployed system could be used as a base for introducing improved components as technical problems are worked out. Obligational authority required for the recommended program equals 3.66 billion dollars for FY 1963-68]. Draft Appendix II to the Memorandum for the President [memorandum, not attached].

In Soviet planning for a military operation, there would have to be so=e diversion of ICBM forces d* penetrate a deployed defense, even &b7agh the economic exchange ratio is unfavorable to the defense. This nsy take the form of extra issiles assigned to saturate, contase, cr destroy anti-missile systems or the introduction of sophisticated reentry vehicles vith penetration systems and other. protective devices. d. Even limited deployment woul, inhibit blackmail from secondary pc-r.ers, provide some protect'ion against -accidental attacks and against viola2ions of arms control agreements. e. So=e counter may be desirable against future Soviet claims to I a successful anti-missile syztem. Soviet efforts in the field of *ballistic =*ssile defense appear to be nore anbitious than our own efforts. Even if U. S. scientists can offer claims of a U.

III. Description, Status, and T.chric al -aiution 1 ,z-- ZEJS, un!er development by Bell Tvlepbone Laboratories since 1955 for the U.S.Azrr , is the oniy active rmti-belllstic xIrsile defenr-e %-stem under barEv-re de-welopcent in the United States or allied countries. About $1.2 billicn has been 1u3eted on the ZEJS R&D progrm through FY 1962, and the develo ent cost, athrough FY 195, is about -t.7 bl1lion. The NLKE Z-S is a te-"il defense syz,., in v.hich the !=cczing targets are detected and t-sz-ed by ra2r, tbe ZEUS missile 's 2EauncLed, steereE to an intercept 1-)int, _nd its vaclear -arhead detonzted by ground co.--s d. A special raaar Irovides some capability of discrf-1-natiom between warhesils and decoys. Testing of parts of the system is vell under vay at 'White Ssmds Missile Range and Ascension Island. -Future tests are also scheduled at Pt. 1SA i and Kvajalein Island. The latter location vill i2ve a complete Z1EUS sy stem, and actual intercepts vii be flown againzst ICIRs fired fro= Vendenberg. Mhese firings are scheduled to begin 6hout April 1962. The I=E ZEUS contr2ztor is very co=petent and experienced and is as qualified as any to handle this very complei Job. Eouever, the system design clearly still suffers from its early disre*ard of the threat of IC- s desigred f6r penetration. i.e... Ueof 1ri redig "cross- section nose C multiple varhe-as, decoys, T active arners. A NDCE ZEUS battery is flexible in organization; the ncminal ZEUS battey would consist of: 1 - Discrimination Radar (DR) 6 - Target Track Radars (TTR) 12 - Missile Track Radars. (MTR) 96 - Interceptor Missiles Such a battery is capable of firing and guidli;g t6 "Laget simul- taneously up to six salvos every twenty-five sec6n&s imatil tbhe missile supply is exhausted. Each salvo normally has tuwo interceptora, to e.sure target kill. In addition to the battery, the ZES systez rquii-es a ZELS Defense Center (ZDC) which includes the powerful Z=JS Acculsition -dar (ZAR). A ZA= detects inccnig r-irsiles and assiGas a battery to perfcr the interception. _.5
Z!7Z -as orIizally designed to be a 75 nautical mile system. - A Zecoyed atf,.c orces ZKO to vithhold defensive missile eCo=1t=ent until targets enter the sensible atmospbere. This restrlcts the range of =JS to a.outl 20 n-utical riles which corresponds to about a 10-mile reZius defede area for an 8 m-egaton yield in the inarg ICBM. After init'I l detection of a target, thee time re;uy_wed for this ZEM cpration is: ZAR z-k a.nd target asEi&=!g nt 20 seconds issile fl2at to target 25 FecoIds Total 45 seconEs This timl-n requires that the ZAR first detect a threatening ICKq at about 200 rsutical miles and the ZEUS interceptor le l bunched %en the target is at 120 nautical miles. The exact ranges depend on the Seometry of the battery and the protected area avA on the ICZK trajectory (including re-entry angle). Improvements in ZEUS are being considered vbich-ebuld reduce the total time required from first'detection to interc&ption to' 35 seconds under favorable conditions and thereby reduce the required detection range to 130-150 nautical miles. An Unportant characteristic of ZEUS is the target altitude 6hen the missile is launched: for typical ICBH trije&tories this altitude, depending on the decoy characteristics, lles betweeix 180,000 and 380,000 feet if interceptor launch is dele;ed to the -1ast possible moment. If objects are not discriminated at that altitude. ZEUS n,1st either launch aainst al of them or take the chance of launching a smaller number of missiles and hoping to redirect them at those vhch are later identified as threatening. If the c1bud contains more varheeAs than ZEUS has launched missiles, the attack succeeds. Thus, the offense can employ decoys to saturate ZMUS. The number of decoys vhich defy identification d*n to the missile altitud6 at'the m=ent of interceptor launch determines the. degree of saturation. D&ccys vhich r-ain umidentifiable by ZFAS do to 200,000 feet altitude are expected to be light (less than 2% of warhead veight) and consequently could be present in large numbers. (This decoy weightiiicreases very raTidly with altitude belov 200,000 feet.) These decqys, like ZEUS d-scrim.n&-tion techniques, are under developent and have not been field tested. The current design ZEUS single or trItiple battery effectiveLess can be characterized as- follovs:

Effective ZEUS operation aSalrkt "bare" missiles Is assured. A single ZEJS battery could success:O'2 defeat about 14 such ICRqs arriving per minute, until the missile supp)ly became exhausted. If the last stage tank could not be identified, vhich is unlikely, the rate V'nich can be handled is reduced by one-half. ff-erational AU7-AS, 'TITANi Is Mi-LM!U' (Wing 1) and POIARIS (Al and A2) are exr_=jlee of such thre Yarginal Zc'US operation can be expected, boevir, vhenever missiles are retrofitted vith penetration aid devices. ATLAS 9 and F (nose cone weight about 3000 lbs.) wvill, by 1963, be equiped ith penetration aid pods weighing about 250 lbs. Aaint s-ach a 'threat ZEUS would.be forced to fire between 2 and 18 interceptors dependIng- on the extent to which ZEUS interceptors can be diverted vith success- ful discrimination after launch and on the assumptions concerning the numzber cf varbeacs in the cloud. A reasonable number might be 12.

Mis would increase the nu=ber of missiles fired agaIn t a single AYLAS by a factor of t.o or rore. 75is leads to the conclu-con that at _cast t.a and probrly four or mrre ZEUS batteries -orkimg in close cooperation uould be required to shoot dovn a single .ATLAS retrofitted with penetration aids.

A few of t con c~sideratio-,s ere brief.7 ~~.~ie beic?: 9
a. The Pcssibility of Eri_z Wealmesses and Errors The possibility of enezy errors and linItetions existing unknown to us is umprovable by detailed an!!tsis. Nowever, several cases of the possible wee -=esses of ICEX systems can be dravn from our --n or o em-le the -ralnrab!lity ra-e of our 1--e-tent reentrL- vehici,'s ir~ F4 Th's ?'be A. rL-x=l.E .eJ -Fs eb vut 'n "IT PsL --mn the vnil-erablty rca s is 1ib. gr ter un.--r spa_cial circui_5tatces and there is no a-5suaance, zhort of field teeting, that this Is n t true in Eeneral. A seconrd example Is the conposition or "mix" of ICBM forces. CThe mlssiles that havi adeq7asite vaight allance for reliable pene- ' ration (ATLAS and TITAN) are relatively vulmnerable to destruction on the ground, hile those missiles which ve wifl have la urge n-mbers anc which are relative%y invulnersble to. a first strike (and POLAMS) baye jarginal paylos&s and design chri2ges =ast be made in order to gain a reasonable ecnfidence that the can make use of the low ross sectiom warheads as a penetration device. b. The Confidence le;vl of Decision Mslers The probleins of when .and how to laurch an ICBM attack axe obviously simplified for the Soviet decision makers if there is no opposing defense. They can rely on a si=ple and virtually certain saturation strategy. Any kind of a defense, however, creates the need for a more complicated and sophisticted attack strategy. This Increases greatly the risk of failure and thus lowers the confidence of the Soviet leaders in their abildty to make a success- ful attack. c. Diversion of Offensive Forces The ana3,ysia"hould be carried LLrther, hrwever, eince a j:- nty haz bn paid for ths capbid The total yield of nuclear payloa. h.s pod r tnhis rve-ueEIeis restraint would persznently ear-Ezk the =dif ied mde-a16--ce as "ballistic misile defense penetrators", and the_se missiles ' co"aAd mot be reassigned by a militaxy planner for v-se as "f.-Out- 2r6duing weapons", for'ex&_-le. Generally, a deployed defense will increase the offensive force re uiremnts or shift the attack to =mdefended t&rgets. .. -
d. Defense Aze.nst Second" Thrests In the foreseeable f,,tuxe seconaxy powers, su=b as Cuba. &n. Chin., may hae s=-&1 or unsoph]5ticate& ballistic rissile fo:rces thet c-ld rePch the United States. It is =ost destrable ta. ve not be vulnerable to such threats or at least not appear to be Avc'nerable. Acidente-l aettadk end attack by s--1I forces that ight evN-de aamzs control a.-ee:nts are other ex--ples of linited attacks that --,nOA =ach better be met by defensive Lystems tha= by co-,nterattack. e. A Counter to Soviet Anti-Missile Develoent Intelligence foun& s6lid evidence IS moths ago that the Soviets vere developing anti-missile ssters on a more ambitious scale than the United States. Developmental radars of e4vamced configaration an2L rA-nLy tirLs larger than azy planne4 by the United Stetes vere observel. Laimching installations indicate a more adv=uced interceptor (SA-4) than IMKE 7US.. Also observed vare launebing Installations b-ssociated vith SA-2, vhich is deployed at 70 defense centers in the U.S.S.R., anl wich might be upgraded to kill ICBMs vith inE-equate p-netration systems. It may be that the current series of nuclear tests incluaes full demonstrations of such anti-missile systems. Even with assurance from our technicians that our second strike force can penetrate such defemses, Soviet clmmz and demo- strations will have a major efrect on the uninformed. here and abroml and may have major political results. V. Growth Capability of NIKE ZEUS " If a decision to deployZEOS is made aw, there ere soae desirable Shanges which can be incorporate into the present ZEU-S system, either meeting first deplo1ymnt or phased-in 'iiter. The w-jor Erea that shculd get attention for Zrovth in the present ZUS is the Discrimination Reair (DR). Improvereit would be directed toverd Increasing range eg!d-_nst -,ran tarEets &nd resistance to electronic Ja-z_rs. Re?.ctio of flight tiz "for a 20 mile i_terception from 25 seconds to about 15 by desigr of a new short-rzge, high performance "sprint" ziesile, vuld gain invaluable ti- for d1scrimdx-ation Lt lover e-ltitudes. Dead zones %ouIld also be reduced. Such an inter- ceptor missile could be'retrofittel to a deploed. ZEUS system with relative ease. ' lOf th." cost of u interccptor :is in the nuclear vaiheed.

4CI Si-reat extent. Since the missiles a=e now only a s Yall Xt of tbe MUS cost, the cost per intercept of the radars vaul& aso hLve to be reia d in order for an i=portemt overall reduction in cost per inte-.ept to take Place. Develc nt of a phsei arrsa" ralar, Imown as Z:4,kR, has recently been initiate. If ccesful it vrii: 1. Ferform all of the r'r fznctics -with one equipment. 2. Rmeove =ost of the rea restrictions an .altiple, hig-rate-of-fire intercept. 3. Greatly increase resistsmnce to ja=zinJQ overcome the ZEUS discrim-1nation radar vuu nerability to lov crosz-section tarets accompaniel by tank freR&nt 4. Eliminate acquisition aelays inherent in the nefi cally scanned MM acquisition radar. 5. Provide tracking perfor=ance adegquate for the short ranges envisioned. YAny of the components of the present ZEUS system ;ould have to be changed if 2A is incorporated in Z ES, so .it voulA in effect be a new system. Effective defense of hard targets can be achieved with a low- pcr.er, hardened radar system similar to ZEUS-ZMAR described above. Such a system vould have very sr_all intercept ranges (under 5 miles) and could therefore bold its fire util the attacking vissiles reach very law altitude. The difficulties of dIscrimination - are greatlT eased or eliminated and firepo-wer problems all viated. Such a system must be hardened but othervise can have less complex an ex- ptnsive components than ZEU.-ZMAR. The two types *of defended targets of interest are co=nand centers and retaliatory forces. For command centers, -the per- instal]ati on alLue defended is probably high enougb to justify a version of Zu=S-ZMAR with its expensive radar. VI. Fanda N and PlannL;g for a Limted Deploy mnt The recc znded progra vould defend six cities and about 39 million people using six ZMDOs, 12 batteries, and 1200 missiles. Each of the 22 batteries would consist of c e discrixnation r aar, six target track rv*&rs, 32 rissile track ra!-.rs, the associted gui&ance monitoring r support eqaipent, an d 96 missiles. After the 43 nonth lead ti,_ the first iuit ould be opereticnal. Total eouir ent would be delivered and instelled in a two year leriod. 32
