Recommended that the responsible agencies should 4use, on a continuing basis, available passive devices for the detection of fissionable materiall pursuant to paragraph 14 of NSC 5802. e. Noted that the Department of State would undertake to examine and report at the next Council meeting, on whether, if there were substantial evidence that any shirment entering the United States under diplomatit immunity contained radioactive material, the Department should advise the-diplomatic re- presentatives of the country concerned that the shipment would be opened by U. S. officials, in the presence of representatives of such country, to determine the nature of the radioactive material. *NSC 53021

(2) To draft proposed legislation, 'which would enable Federal authorities to take more effective action in this area, for consideration for submission at this session of the Congress. E. Requested the Department of the Treasury to pre- pare for Presidential approv21 the programs to implement all aspects of para,graph 19 of 1SC 5802; such draft to include (1) instructions taking into account the new Executive Order referred to in f-(M) above and (2) appropriate provisions along the lines of those stated in NSC Action No. 1781 (which related U.

STATIME NT of U. S. POLIcy ONl C0NTTj'M-TAjV. DF'EU!SE SCOPE 1. Tais statezent of p.olicy on "cont!menta1 defense" does not en-. c::ass all elements of U. S. or allied strength contributing to the dezense of iorth A=erica, but is limited as follows: a. Only thosa U. S. rolic!es are Lnc!uded uhich are essentially dcfensive in nature, i.e., Vhih ccntriute directly to th-! de:rezze of the .T".orth A.zerican Co.tinnt and to the protection of that ele- r:n t of our retal1ator- ca-abil1ty Ia-ed on the N[orth .Aericaa Con. tinent. b. This statfet--Z of policy d-es not include prograzs . Tbe cmiss!on from this state;2eri of prozra-ns does not of its,lf cancel or ch.--.ge any program oet forth in NSC 54o8. iob:ever, the respom- sible agencies should reviewr such proGra=s in the liCht of this policy statement to determine whetl:er such programs are currently valid or should be cancelled or chan-ged. RT1ATIVE -%.-MASIS 2. 7ae defense of the United States is an inteerated complex of offensive and defensive elements and of military and ncn-military meas- ures. Each of these has its -roner role in deterring an attack or in the defense of the United States chould an attack occur. Predcminant emphasis should continue to be placed uron -easures to strengthen our effective nuclear retaliatory power as a deterrent and to improve our active dcfe-nses, as compared irith--but not to the exclusion of--rassive defense measures. Particular emphasis should be accorded those active and rassive defense aeasures essential to the protection of the U. S. capability for prompt nuclear retaliation. An effective North American continental dcfense system ;ill constitute one of the key deterrents to Pn attack on the ITorth American Continent. O hTLCT WV'S . * 3. The United States should be prerared at all t.'mes to counter an attack on the Nlorth American Continent in such a ;ay as to deter Soviet attack or, if an attack occurs, to incure our survival as a frce nation. 1,SC 5rzo1p-
a. Such preparation rcquires that the Unitcd States achleva ndn rnInain, in collaboration with Canada and other Free World nt!on , a continental defense readiness and capability which will protect and permit the launchinG of our nualear retaliatory forces, evcn in the event of surprise attack. b. Such prararation should: (i) rrovide warning to alert the nation to impending attack. (2) Counter ene- y subversive and clandestine efforts. (3) Prevent the threat OA nuclear 6as Z-action 1rJ-C undA restricting U. S. frcedom of action or .Les ng national rrale. (4) L-aintain adaptability to rake ti-ely changes as tech- noloar permits and as the nature of the threat changes. (5) Provide appropriate zeasures of protection for the civ-il poulation. c. Such zrez aration should include appropriately organizing, protecting and placing in a condition of readiness the resources of the country essential to national survival. 4. The ti=e-n. ,sing of U. S. "continental defense" x-asures should t-ke into accoiunt the thleat osed by the present nuclear megaton attack carability of the USSR and by anticipated future i rovenents in Soviet w'-pons and delivery capabilities. 7articularly the achieve"ment of a sig- nificant IC:M capability.* Effek_Lve continental defense requires that the United States should be constantly on C.ard against "technolouical -urnrise" and should continually strive for tecLnological superiority. a.. * .3i'E 11-10-57, "The Soviet ICM PrograC", Deceber 17, 1957, esti=ates - that the USSR urll probably have an opemational capability Wilth up to 10 prototype IC.r1's carable of carrying hiGh-yield nuclear varheads, during the period mid-1958 to mid-1959; and cculd have 100 operational ICEL's atout one year after its first operaticnal ca_abili date (i.e. , =id-1959 to mid-160), and 500 ICE4's at6ut '.o or at most three, years after first operational carability d_te (i.e., rid-lgc0 to mid-1962). It is estimated that the first 100 to 200 Soviet ICE-'s -'culd have a fifty Fer cent system reliability end t-hat succcedin" wearons would have a system reliability up to seventy per cent. I-C5O1

T4CTiCAL VA'i.;G ACAD NST A !RC:AT A ?I MISSILES 7. Tactical ,;arnLng of an iaending attack, including very high - Sa'nd very lo.'-!v1 altitude detection and sea surveillance, should be provided to as-sure adequate tize for'counter-offensive forces to initi- afe action, r defense forces to achieve alert readiness, and for civil defonse, internal security and other non-militar-y measures to be effect- ively inplIzco:n,ed. To this end: s. Cur early warning radar network and its seaward extensions should be improved. t. WeaRnesses in identification techniques should be reredied. c. An effective early warning radar system against ICBMI's should be developed and brought into operation as an integral "art of the air defense systcm: as a matter of the hi&,est national pri- ority.
