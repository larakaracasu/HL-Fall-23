DECLASSIFIED SIECRETAuthority R.O. 116740 SEC. 5(A) 2rd (D) By - NARS, Date .. - '" Two RB-57E Twin-Jet Reconnaissance Aircraft, Equipped To Take Day, Night and Infrared Photographs, Have Arrived in Southeast Asia, Making Four RB-57Es Now There The first 2 have infrared (IR) sensors for photos which must be developed and processed by photo interpreters before the intelligence can be used. The 2 most recent arrivals have the sensors plus a cockpit display or "read-out" which alerts the crew to suspicious ground activity. The "read-out" permits a second or third pass over an area to obtain confirmation or more detail. The RB-57 crew can then alert friendly attack forces by radio immediately. Primary IR reconnaissance objective is to locate fleeting targets, such as vehicles, troops and watercraft, for quick reaction attacks; but equipment is new and effective employment tactics are still being developed. Also, not all IR emissions (positive signals of ground acttvity) result in attacks for several reasons. The target area may be too close to friendly personnel. There may be reasonable doubt as to whether the target is hostile or friendly. The emissions may be too few to justify attack; or it may be more desirable to allow the enemy to remain in a location until a suitable attack can be launched. With this increased reconnaissance capability, more emphasis is expected to be placed on swift strike reactions to ground activity.

Two Women's Army Corps Personnel Have Been Assigned to U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam In November 1964, Republic of Vietnam notified General Westmoreland that they intended to establish a Women's Army Corps (WAC) School in January 1965, with a concurrent increase in the strength of the Republic of Vietnamese WAC. WACs have been used by the Vietnamese in social services and as medical assistants. The program will be extended to use Vietnamese women in all types of administrative positions. Vietnamese officials requested assignrrent of a U.S. WAC officer and enlisted woman knowledgeable in operation of and training conducted in a WAC School. Major Kathleen Wilkes, Collins, Georgia, and Sergeant First Class (E7) Betty L. Adams, Woodside, Long Island, New York, were selected and departed for Republic of Vietnam on 13 January 1965.

Turkey Is Sharing the Cost of an Increasing Amount of Materiel Required for Turkish Armed Forces In the late 1950s, the Government of Turkey (GOT) commenced as sembling a U.S. commercial model, 1/4 ton truck furnished through U.S. Military Assistance Program (MAP). In 1961, the GOT proposed to expand this self-help project in Mutual Security to encompass assembly of a modified, U. S. military type 2-1/2 ton truck for issue to the Turkish Armed Forces. At the Joint U. S. Military Mission for Aid to Turkey (JUSMMAT) 's invitation, U. S. Army Mobility Command engineers con- firmed that private and public truck assembly firms in Turkey could efficiently assemble this medium size general cargo truck at an economical rate. Initial shipment of partially assembled 2-1 / 2 ton trucks arrived in Turkey in September 1963. MAP supplied all components for the initial order of 1, 297 trucks. The second increment of 1,144 trucks was furnished less 27 items, e.g. tires, batteries, canvas and flat metal parts, which would be supplied by GOT sources. A contract for a third increment of over 900 kits of truck parts will be awarded to a U. S. truck producer in February 1965. Two additional items, complete frame assembly and radiator, will be supplied .by the GOT from sources in-country. The savings to MAP will exceed one-third of the dollar value of a comparable, completely built-up truck. The stimulus to the truck assembly industrial base in Turkey that resulted from this self-help effort attracted a U. S. firm, International Harvester. Corp. (IHC), to become a partner in the Turkish firm that has assembled the first 2 shipments of these trucks. IHC was the U. S. firm that supplied the initial trucks to the GOT under this project. U. S. and Turkish industry have benefited. The savings to MAP exceeds $2, 000 per 2-1/2 ton truck. DoD 26 Jan 1965 - - -LSR m
The NATO Army Advisory Group, Established in 1963 To Advise the NATO Council and NATO Armament and Military Committees on Army Matters, Held Its Fourth Meeting in-Paris, 1-2 December 1964 U. S., U.K. and France are each developing combat area communi- cations systems which will be incompatible with one another. The NATO Army Advisory Group (NAAG) voiced its alarm over ihis trend and has asked a working group to define what must be done to insure interopera- bility. The current difficulty of ground forces to communicate can be further compounded by this divergency in development of equipment. In a related field, the NAAG noted the inability of the several NATO groups considering data processing and transmission to identify major requirements for the land forces. Each NATO army has requirements for various automatic data processing systems for such functions as intelligence, logistic support and fire control. The NATO groups, how- ever, have been unable to identify any common requirements. As in the case of combat zone communications, diverse developments could lead to incompatible systems which would preclude transmission of essential data between armies. The NAAG has asked the military authorities to assist in identifying the major requirement for the land forces. DoD 26 Jan 1965 CC) -y &

I! DECLASSIFTED SA uthority E.O. sEC. (A ,,d ( By NARS, Date 9 / Army Has Been Assigned Responsibility for Delivery of 4 Armed, New Production UH-IB Helicopters for Venezuela and for Provision of Necessary Pilot and Maintenance Training Two UH-lB helicopters were to come from December 1964 pro- duction and 2 from February 1965 production. Delivery schedule of the aircraft has proceeded satisfactorily, however, a Venezuelan request on 6 November 1964 establishing a new requirement that the UH-lBs be painted silver aluminum delayed aircraft availability by about 2 weeks. The Venezuelan authorities requested that the first 2 aircraft be delivered by Venezuelan surface craft departing from Houston, Texas. The first 2 aircraft were disassembled, packed, crated and ready for shipment on 23 December 1964. These aircraft were trucked to the port of Houston, Texas, on 24 December 1964, and were placed aboard a Venezuelan ship (Nueva Sparta) on 28 December 1964. No difficulties are presently fore- seen in provision of the 2 remaining UH-lBs during February 1965. Necessary pilot and maintenance training is being accomplished in part, in U. S. and the balance by means of a Mobile Training Team in Venezuela. Four Venezuelan pilots arrived at Lackland AFB, Texas, on 8 November 1964. After they were administered the standard language proficiency test, it was determined that from 7 to 23 weeks of language training would be required for them to reach the proficiency needed to meet flight safety requirements. An alternate training plan was developed in order to provide expeditiously the Venezuelans with an operational capa- bility. Spanish-speaking UH-1B instructor pilots accomplished this training at Ft. Benning, Georgia, using 1 lth Air Assault Division facilities. The 4 Venezuelan pilots began their training at Ft. Benning on 30 November 1964. Upon completic.i of the required training, they returned to Venezuela to be available upon aircraft arrival.- Four enlisted maintenance personnel arrived at Lackland AFB on 8 November 1964 for language testing and training. Two completed maintenance training at Ft. Rucker, Alabama, on 3 December 1964, and 2 weeks of intensive on-the-job maintenance training with the 1lth Air Assault Division on 17 December 1964. The remaining 2, undergoing English language training at Lackland AFB, will, upon acquiring required language proficiency, enter the appropriate maintenance training course, tc be followed by two weeks of on-the-job maintenance training.

Air Force Is Testing LASER as a Target Ranging Device An F4C fighter, equipped with a LASER range finder in place-of its conventional radar, has been used in a series of low level air-to- ground tests at Vrhite Sands Missile Range, The LASER (light ampli- fication by stimulated emission of radiation) has an extremely narrow beam, enabling aircraft to come in at a very low angle (as low as 5 degrees) and still acquire accurate range information. Consisting of several small units which fit into the F4C radome, the system promises to improve accuracy of air-to-ground attack. It will also compute the exact instant of fire or release, giving the pilot an extra margin of safety for pull-out. DoD 26 Jan 1965 L o-P r.L..

2 Air Force Plans ZERO DEFECTS Seminar in Program Aimed at Error-Free Performance Attended by representatives of all major air commands, the seminar will be conducted in the Pentagcn 27 January 1965 by spokesmen for Air Force and U. S. industry. The ZERO DEFECTS Program is aimed at getting the job done right the first time. It has been in effect in the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) and the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) since August 1964. As implemented by AFLC and AFSC, ZERO DEFECTS is designed to develop in Air Force military and civilian-person- nel a feeling of pride in everything they do and thereby prevent mistakes before they happen. All Air Force personnel have been asked t- improve the quality of their work by meticulous attention to individual performance. The program will be stressed by Air Force during 1965 with a variety of motivating materials, promotional campaigns and awards for error-free performance. The conference in the Pentagon will explain the working details of the program ane assist commands in developing and implementing individual programs.

Air Force Has Requested Legislation Waiving $5, 000 Limit on Payment of Claims Resulting from Wichita, Kansas, Air- craft Crash On 18 January 1965. Air Force Secretary Zuckert sent proposed legislation to Congress which would remove the $5, 000 ceiling limiting Air Force's authority to settle and pay claims resulting from the KC-135 crash at Wichita. Defense and Bureau of the Budget concurred in the action. Title 10, U.S. Code 2733, permits payment of amounts not in excess of $5, 000 on any one claim arising out of the noncombat activities of the military department concerned. Any greater amounts must be re- ported to the Congress for special legislation. Secretary Zuckert's pro- posal would eliminate the $5, 000 ceiling and permit administrative settlement and payment of any amount found to be legally due to a claimant without the necessity of additional action by Congress. Air Force sponsorship of this legislation is in accord with the assurances made by Secretary Zuckert in his communication to the Governor of Kansas that Air Force would do all possible to assist in the relief of victims. Preliminary reports show that over 20 local people were killed, 15 homes were completely destroyed, and 75 homes damaged by the crash. DoD 26 Jan jr65 r

Re-entry vehicle impact was planned in the Eniwetok Lagoon, about 4, 384 n. mi. down range, with a 15.1 degree re-entry angle. In addition to the MTV, missile also carried a co-prime payload, the Air Force Office of Aerospace Research orbital vehicle (OVI-1). It was planned for OVl-1 to inject a scientific payload into orbit after separation from the ATLAS booster. Ignition and lift-off were normal. Missile flight azimuth was close to planned, but trajectory was slightly higher than planned. Sustainer engine appeared to have shutdown about one second prior to guidance shut- down command. Preliminary impact prediction from the General Electric Range Tracking System (GERTS) was 218 n. mi. short and 1 n. mi. right. Recovery of re-entry vehicle was not attempted because of the large miss distance. The OV1 -1 apparently did not go into orbit. Cause of the short range of the re-entry vehicle and failure of OVI-1 to orbit are not known at this time.
