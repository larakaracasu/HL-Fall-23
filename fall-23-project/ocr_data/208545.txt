The visit vill also give you an ortnit to discus the Alliance for Progress with Presidents etancourt and Leras in the light of their unique experience and stand n"g. Venezuela The present Government of Venezuela, under the leadership of - President R&nlo Betancourts Is In the vanguard of the Latin American forces of democrtics evo3tionary economic and social reform. Your visit vill also provide concete evidence of U.S. support for representa- tve,~ d ti, constitutional Van and encioragement to this system as an alternative to authoritarianism of the Left or Eight. The Venezuelan Government's economic deve2opment program bas been retarded by a serious business recession dwing the last three years. Consequently it is modifying Its four year investment pla to focus on the 1mediate problem of 3 CIng economic recovery and reduci critical mn0oYI. It hopes trough substantial new investment, p3anned by the entra overamput but utilizing both pblic and private sectors, to retun to an cpa le rate of G grovth by the deve2opuent of new ind and the basic infra-structare necessarY for in -t zsUon.

-2- Agrarian Reform Program has, been able to achiee signifIcant Increases In Wrcultural prodction over the 3st tw yaws. The Venezuelan Goverament's social -e - program rests on its four year investment plan and ito 1960 a Refom p rao. Both aim at a rapid and balanced developnent of human and pbysical resources to raise the standard of living of the lowest income groups. Targets of the Investment plan are educational and training institutIonst housing, sanitary facilities, social services, rural conmunity develop- ment and urban renewal. There has beent rAl. dnerese in" the - ng-wor bf primary and secondary schools and in facilities for vocational and tecluical training. Under the Agrarian Reform Program, which pro- vides for the distribution of agricultural land and financial, tecbn*- cal and marketing assistance to small farmers, the government has alrea4y resettled more than 30,000 families, providng man of them wIth housing and other basic needs. Ths far these programs have been financed primarily by Venezue3an funds. Hoever, a considerable portion of financial assistance contemplated for future needs will be fro foreign sources. A start bA(s already been made in both rural and urban housing loans from -.S. supplied ftinds, and additional credits are being negotiated to finance other projects. The influence of President Betancowrt as one of the top leaders of the democratic, moderate reform movement in Latin America, 'as opposed to proponents of violent social revoIntionaxy upheaval and totalitarian development methodsp renders the success of his constitu- tional regime of vital Ilqoaance to U.S. interests. Venezuela Is recognized as a high priority target for communist domination in the Western Hemisphere and, with existing social 'nequ:Lties and the feudal economic structure which underlie its rich petroleum facade, the country is extremely vulnerable. U.S. support of this progressively inclined., reform-minded &overment is warranted by conside tons of Western Hemisphere security and stability far beyond the concern which we also have for the people of Yeneela. The baslc U.S. aproach to Venezuela is to stwort, the latter 's rtic goverment as an exple of & mderat refom administration seekingto solve basic problems trough ar es e and sound economic and social develoluent; to maintain access to its vital raw materials; and to encours the Venezelan Governme*t to play an active and constructive role In Caribbean and Hemisphere affairs.

THE PESIENT 'S VISIT TO VENEZUELA AND (LDMBIA December A,, 1961 ecomber, lY1M U.S. Pblicy With Respect to Latin America I. Basic Approach The importance of Latin America to United States policy is older than the Xonroe Doctrine and stems from the position of two continents whose security is interdependent. Today, three aspects of Latin America are intimately in- terlinked and together define the challenge facing the United States. In many countries, social tensions are mounting, and growing public dissatisfaction is directed against..privileged groups who have ruled for genera- tions without successfully dealing with major social and economic problems. There is a growing desire on the part of important governments to pursue a 'foreign policy increasingly independent of U.S. influence. Using Cuba as a major base or operations, Communist organization is attempting with purpose and skill to capture both of these movements and turn them against the United States. Our str4tegy in this situation ist a) to lead and assist Latin America in a major *bTdrt to satisfy basic human wants and to rigfit old wrongs by the Alliance for Progress, estimated to cost $20 billion from all outside sources, public and private over the next ten years; b) to frustrate the efforts of Communists to gain control of these revolutionary forces and to strengthen Latin Americans' will and capacity to resist Communist subversion and to isolate the Communist beachhead in Cuba; and e) to strengthen the inter-American system and cultivate closer relations with all the Latin American countries and peoples, especially with those key-nations which appear destined to play an important role in the Hemisphere and in the world, such as Brazil, Argentina, ,and Mexico. In this enterprise we must exert liberal leadership. We must cooperate to the fullest with the self-help efforts of countries seeking to modernize themselves. We must disassociate ourselves from reactionary forces which decline to respond to the needs of the people, and learn to discriminate between legitimate expressions of dissatisfaction with the existing social order and Communist-inspired agitation. We must influence and help the military to become guardians of constitutional order and agents of constructive change. We must be patiently understanding of the growing pains of countries which in striving to establish their national identity are feeling a temporary need to dramatize their independence from us. We must commit the resources required for the task. During the next decade,, our problems will become more complex, rather than less. The tide of change is bound in the short run to work against certain of our immediate interests. Old power groups will be increasingly estranged from us as me press for basic reforms. New groups in power will often be more difficult to deal with than leaders of the past. Through these years, we will have to keep our long run interests clearly in mind - a continent to the south made up of viable political societies capable of maintaining their independence and of dealing adequately with their own internal problems. 10% - DEC ,Da

Recommended U.S. Position The U.S. is not in a position to respond favorab3y to a Venezuelan request for the sale or loan of a ,ubarine., as there in at present no U.S. legislative authority ulich would penit such a trans- action. T the event it should be decided to request'the Congress to authorize- a program of U.S. naval vessels for transfer to Latin Aerican countriess, Venezuelats desire to obtain a submarine will be taken into account,s
General Discussion The U.S. provided Venezuela in 1960 with one sumarine, which was rehabilitated at the expense of the Venezuelan Government, under the provisions of Public Law 85-220 of August 29, 19!7. Adviral Carlos A. Larrazabal of the Venezuelan Navy, in a personal letter dated November 20, 1960 to A al Arleigh Burke, requested the U.S. to provide the Venezuelan Navy with a second subtarine. Ado4ral Burke replied on December 21, 1961 that a request should be initiated by the Venezuelan Government on a Government-to-Government basis, pointing out that the provision of such a warship would require approval of the Executive as wel as the Legislative Branch of the U.S. Goverment. Our Naval Attache at Caracas reported on November 3, 1961 that Admiral Larrazabal at a reception in commemoration of U.S. Navy Day reiterated the desire of the Venezuelan Navy to acquire a second submarine. On November 9, 1961, our Ambassador discussed the request with President Betancourt who stated that Venezuela could not afford a second submarine. On December 5, 1961, the Department informed our Embassy that in view of a) the negative attitude of the Venezuelan President, b) the absence of existing or proposed new ship legislation, and c) the reluctance of the Executive Branch to stimulate a new ship loan or sales program for Latin America,-no further initiative should be taken by the Embassy or our Naval representatives in Venezuela in regard to the request and that the matter should be allowed to lapse. Subsequently, President Betancourt informed our Chargg that, after discussing this matter at length with his Naval Officers, he had become convin6ed that a second submarine should-be acquired to improve the Navy's capability to resist incursions from Cuba or elsewhere. He said that a crew had alread been trained to man another submarine.
December 6, 1961 TM PWMWIUtS VISIT TO VEMEU An COL=TA .Dec.ember. 1961 Position Paper Civil Aviation Problm (May be raised at Venezuelan initiative) Anticipated Veeznelan Pogition The Govermeza of Venemula has requested that the U.S. Govarn- ment approve the Calwiing of its routes 2 and 3 of the U.S.-Veuezuelan bilateral Transport Agremet (ATL), to permit the Venezuelan airline, VIASA, to serve Wiami',nd Sew ran on the same operation. ecommended. U.S. PaaWon The U.S. is A1gr0ab3A to the Veezuelan proposal, provided that the Govermnt. -of VenezuelA wi3l add Maracaibo to U.S. route 4 of the Air Transport Agreemnt to pemit the U.S. airline (Delta) to serve Naracalbo and Carsoas on the sme operation. The U.S. also agreed to make the change on a trial basis of one year, if desired.
jy /a Discussion The Vensuelan Government in July 1963. approached this Govern.- nt requesttg . an important amtn its Carbbean routes 2 and 3, serving the United States. The U*S*-V=ezueI&n aviation agreement was siped on August J, 1953. Th agrement contained a route pattern which had been utuall agreed upon and uhich represented an equal competitive opportunity based on economic potential, taking into consideration the trffic generated by the U.S. The delineation of the routes and the points to ba served are established to adjust the coa. petitive situation over ar. given route, When competitive equality has been reached in the-roates, aW improemnt in one will affect the other unless a similar iprovment is made. Under provisions of Article X of the Air Transport Agreement, consultations were. held in Washington from August. 8 to Augst 18, 1961. .. At this tim, the U.S.. deleation set forth consecutively three distinct proposals which would establish t route adjust- ments for a trial. period .of one year. Each proposal constituted a realistic attempt to. met. the Venezuelan aviation problem. In exehAnge, the U.S. asked that Maracaibo'be named as a co-terminal on U.S. route 4 and thatVenezuela give the capacity principles of the Air Transport Agremt a full and fair trial. The final offer mads,bI the U.S., as stated above, was to cancel its route 3 ( Cuba-Colomb-Maracaibo) and add Maracaibo to U.S. route 4, making it rea-. ft-f Orleans-Cuba-Jamaica.Netherlands West Indies-aracaiboCaracas (fecause of the political situation, Havana is no longer Aekved on this route), in return for adding *Niami to Venezuelan xma. 3, making it read: Caracas-Naracaibo- Jawica-Miami-New Orleans. The U.S. delegation ccasidered our pro- posal to be a fair one and one which would adequately provide for the conatinud operation of both the U.S. and Venezuelan airlines over the Caribbean route. The Venezuelan delegation at these consultations, refused to discuss any other exioting problem (violation of the agreement) or to even consider the-.ropoals.presented by the U.S. to acco odate its desires. In .essence, the Venezuelan Government took a vey rigod position, nade no -onter proposals, and Implied that it would denounce the Air Transport Agreemnt unless the U.S. grants it the additional rights without giving amytbing in retur. The Venezuelan Government has infoxmed both the American Embassy in Caracas and the Department that its airline, VIASA, was losing heavily on the two separate operations to Mimi and New Orleans, wile, at the am tim, the President of VIAS i wnformed the xport Import Bink (oter of October 6, 1961 to Xr. Balderston from Oscar Nachado K ' * +, ... . *.-

It has suspended its operations to Cuba, Haiti and the Damin Repblic. Its deficit In this reMaining operation to Caracas Is-preently beinfecarried by its domestic operation. If the U.S. grnts VIA its request without, at the ame tJ., helping Delta. to be. in a. better position to face increased compeition which the combination of these two Sroutes wokld cause, the latter carrier wdl probably be forced to auspend its Caribbean service. The rigid position of the Venezuelan delegation to the aviation consultation wab reiterated to Departant official by Dre Maue3l L Rivero, who heads the Foreign Comerce Section of the Venezuelan * Foreign Ministry, during his visit In Washington., the *week of November 28. Dr. -ivero; again requested the U.S. Goverment. to reconsider its position to see whether or bot it would be possib3le, on the basis of friendship and..other considerations, to grant the Venezuelan request. The Government of Venezuela is striving-, -to insure a comptitive advantage for its airline in the Caribbean operation. The Air Transport Agreement between the U.S. and Venerjela was siged on August 14, 1953. The Venezuelan Goverment airline (LAV) started operations to New York and a private Venezuelan line (AVESA) to Mimi and New Orleans. IAV was carrying over 50% load factor and had a profitable operation but, after some political changes in the campwW, main.- tenance became lax and the compmW had tbree serious accidents which lost it the confidence of the tveing public, including Venezuelan nationals. It finally suspended its Omation to the U.S. in 1960. AVNSA operated two profitabla routes, one to Miami and the otber to New Orleans, until the recent pltical situation In'the Caiibbean area (buba and the Dmnica Revabic) adversely affected all travel. After the LAV difficunles, the Venezuelan Government started a restrictive interpretation of the agrement. The Venezuelam Government refuased to permit Pan American to operate Iis~ IatIn* Ameicn services with Jets into and through Caracas for 18 montIs . The Venezuelan Goverment is also violating the agrement y con- trolIng the umber of frequencies which can be operated by U.S. .. . .... . . -- 4..' i

This airline has purchas"d two Convair 880's to operate Its routes to the U.S., has applied for an I loan to finance them and has now requested combination of routes 2 and 3 to permit Miazi and Iew Orleans to be served on the same route. This combination will: (a) Provide operational economles; (b) provide opportwnity for recapacity; avidj, (c) Increase its base for back-up traffic. Drafted by: Ce ared by: ARAM W: ussell ZIAV -kw.

He is also the principal leader of the Social Christian Party (COMI), the Njun-1ir partner' in the two partW coalition goVe t of President Betancourt. (See Background Paper, Tab B Page 12 for a description of COM1X and biographic sketch Tab2 of Biographic Briefing Book). An attorney and professor of law at Car*cas' Central Univer- sity, he is politically, professional1y, sociall and morally one of the most highly respected men in Venezuela and was his party' s unsuccessful candidate for the Presidency in the 1947 afid 1958 elections. Dr. Culdera, President Betancourt and Dr. Jovito Villalba, principal leader of the Democratic Republi- can Union Party (URD), are the major figures of Venezuelan political leadership during the past fifteen years. Dre Caldera enjoys widespread Latin American renown as an authority in labor law and as one of the principal leaders of the Latin American Social Christian movement. President Betancourt is dependent on COPEI s votes for a working govern- ment majority in the ;hamber of Deputies. Thus Dr. Caldera and COPE! enjoy a unique position on the Venezuelan political scene. Dr. Caldera and his party are sensitive to the fact that Venezuela'A present government is a co- alition government in which they play a ver7 important role; and his discussion of the political situation will be strictly within the context of fthe Coali- tion Government', emphasizing COE7s significance, rather than in term of "the Betancourt Government". He may wish to discuss the Social Christian movement in Latin America, emphas,ng that Christian parties are growing in influence throughout the continen*. Dr. Caldera believes there is some prejudice in the United States against SO ia Christians because of their Roman Catholic orientation. He may also expres,concern over what he considers to be prejudiiial conditions which have prelued the registration of the Social Christian Party in Puerto Rico. He my state. his interest in hA_ping to establish a Social Christian Party In . the democratc atmo eve deVeloping in the Dominican Republic; he m request U. S. "assistance in tra Dominicans in political party and goWerMent&9 organization to help fill the void in shifting from dictatorship to democracy. Regarding Cuba, Dr. Caldera may express COPEI' s condmnation of totall- tarianism, executions and other atrocities of the Castro regime and its, betAt-. _-MDati

General Remrks You my wish to indicate your awareness of Dr. Caldera' s and COPEI's important and constructive role on the Venezuelan political scene. You have been following with interest Venezuela' s efforts to establish democratic stability with social and economic progress. You have noted the com-ndable joint effort of the two parties n the coalition government to achieve these goals to which the people of Venezuela have so long aspired. - &0 te d T'Res!ofide th~iti 2M Calders, Nay Wish to RLiseo 1. Social Christian Movement in Latin America You may wish to state that you: are cognizant of the importance of the Social Christian movement. You are -sure that many inforaed persons in the C United States appreciate its key role in fostering social reform, economic progress and democratic government. in Latin America. 2. Social Christian Party in Puerto Rico You may wish to state your understanding that this party has not been able to meet the requirement of minimum merbership for reistration purposes. Since this is a question of legal requirements and the applicable laws are local rather than national in character, it might be prefefable. for Dr. Caldera to exchange views on this matter with Governor Muoz Karn or other representa- tives of the Cononwealth. 3. Social Christian Activities in the Dominican Repu1lic You may wish to reply that the United States does not comit itself to support any particular democratic group In the Dominican Republic or elsewhere.

Consequently, AD Party activities have been largely under the leadership of Leoni and Barrios since 1959. These two veteran politicians helped Betancourt found the AD Party in 19hi and have been associated with him for almost thirty years. They are both considered to be staunch supporters and close friends of Betancourt, have his complete trust and are -e Ah capable apd intelligeht polltiiaa - It is not anticipated that either of them is likely to raise any substantive matters.

-2- to have grown steadily stronger* An equivalent subversive 'threat has been posed by extremists of the Left, including Commmists, who have been attempt- ing through agitation, organized disturbances, terrorist activities and propaanda to discredit the government and cause itsi downfall. President Betanourt's earlier reluctance to act against the Left extremists was abandoned over a year.ago and, since the Left-extremists inspired riots of October-November 1960, he has adopted a firm position and moved forcefully to suppress their attempts to incite to violence. The increased belligerency of the far Left opposition political parties, following the ouster of Left- wing extremists from the President' s own AD Party in April 1960 and the separation of the URD Party from the coalition in November 1960, has resulted in a clearer delineation of political forces and has left the President with a somewhat smalIer but considerably more homogenous support for his present two-party coalition (AD and COPEI). The ouster lof AD's Left-wing extremists reduced AD's majoreity in the Chamber of Deputies to a pluralty,. but the com- bined AD-COPEI strength in that House still gives the government parties .a workiag majority over the combined opposition forces. President Betancourt enjoys the majority support of organized labor and land workers and of a number of professional and business leaders and organizations. If he can deal effectively with the serious economic and social problems facing the country during the next two years, the prospect would bode well for democratic politi- cal stability and further economic and social progress in the future. In the event that the economic situation should fail to improve or even deteriorate more seriously it would greatly impair the viability of the present political system and would seriously limit the government' s capability to confront the broad social problems with the necessary rapidity and effectiveness to meet popular aspirations. rDradtad by: Cleared by: IP:RAR:WSimonson: Deputy Coordinator - Mr. We AA:EST:94oekowitz Â§LS--R,: WWrant2F'- 7227p l2q. 4154 !0 V

Weaknesses In the Current Situation With an mtboritarian tredition, as evidenced by the fact that only eight of the tbirty Veezuelan presidents since 1830 have not been generals, yenezuela has had little experience in the free play of constitutional democ- racy and historical1y the Venezuelan people have accepted a rightist military solution vhen it appeared.. Venezuela has an extrmelvocal and aIlitant leftist, pro-Castro minority. This exerts itself in student circles vhIch are so -tradtionally politically influential in Latin America. leftist extremists are strong in the newspaper and some other professions. The dominant AD party Is split, principally into the camp of the "OlA Guard" of President Betancourt and a more radical leftist wing vhich vants more nationalism, less cooperation vith the Uited States and less foreign and domes- tic private enterprise.

S Political stability seems to depe6d on one heart, that of President Betancourt, and it is generilly believed that were he to disappear suddenly from the scene, either by normal death or by assassination, chaos would re- sult. The government forced primarily by leftist activity (but also by right-. ist attempted coupsi has been obliged to suspend such constitutional guarantees as freedom of press, assembly, home, unrestricted travel, and this opens it up to legitimate claims of violating human freedoms and rights. There are poli- tical prisoners. Strengths in the Current Situation With the backing of -two-thirds of the electorate and with a leadership which is dedicated to the establishment and maintenance of constitutional democracy, the government coalition doeswork. The government is not afraid to use its powers to maintain its position. While some say that suspension of constitutional guarantees might be a sign of weakness, at the same t-imel-t indicates the government is not afraid to use all the forces at its commtuA when necessary to maintain stability and meet the threat of subversives. President Betancourt- isa consummate politican. He knows when to act and when to let nature ta.ke its course. He has a mystical following in the interior of the country and derives strength as an internationally respected statesman. The AD party, unlike most Latin parties, is a disciplined, hard-hitting orgaization. Blooded in exile and clandestine activity during most of its twenty year history, it knows how to use the bureaucracy for its own advantage. It knows what to do with patronage. The party is by far the dominant force . in the Venezuelan labor movement and the half-million member Landworkers' Federa- tion is AD. With labor and peasants firmly in its camp, AD is a force to be reckoned with. As a matter of fact it is not to be excluded that the AD i. so strong that it may be dangerous for the complete evolution of a-democratic Venezuela in that it could represent a unitary, majority force in the country. The majority of the armed forces appear to recognize that it is in their enlightened self-interest to* support the constitutional democracy. The Cuban experience, wherein the career armed forces were destroyed, has had a great effect on the Venezuelan military. Betancourt has carefully removed officers of doubtful loyalty and has replaced them with men in whom he feels confidence. The President feels that he must replace antiquated military equipment with new as partial payment for this military support. The government haf made a major socio-economic effort, in the rural areas. Schools have been buU , roads constructed, and. agrarian rform in.-tiated.. K. .f od ontutd
Recent Background: Tri-Party Coalition of 1959 ADIs candidate, R&mao Betancourt, was elected President by a near majority for a five-year term in December 1958, and the party received a majority of seats in both houses of the Congress. Betancourt was Inaug6rted without inci- dent in February 1959 and, in conformance with the pre-election accords, or- .ganized a coalition government in cooperation with the URD, COPM and political independents, which was endorsed by the armed forces and all major non-political civilian groups. The Venezuelan Commtnist Party (Partido Comunista de Venezuela - PCV) was excluded from the government at the instance of outspoken anti- Commuist elements in the three major parties, but it continued to abide by the coalition and government of national unity principles. In the political field the policy of the Betancourt government until late 1960 was directed toward preserving harmonious relations among the political parties as a prerequisite for survival of constitutional, democratic government and for effective action on economic and social problems. Despite the forma- tion in mid-1960 of an extremist opposition grouping to the AD-led administra- tion, effrrts continued to consolidate support among moderate political forces. Preservation of an apolitical role for the armed forces and effective measures to combat subversion have also constituted essential ingredients of political policy. At the same time, the full observance of constitutional processes and respect for political liberties have been strongly emphasized by the Betancourt government, reflecting widespread popular repudiation of the repressive aspects of the Pfrez JimAnez and earlier dictatorial regimes. These policies have con- tinued to be approved by the majority of the population including the major parties, non-political groups and responsible military leadership who share the belief that ever7 effort should be exerted to avoid a return to authoritarian government. Subversive Activities Despite. this support from Influential groups in the country, the Betancourt governent has faced a series of subversive plots and coup attempts organized by exiled military and civilian Pere imenistas (followers of PSrez JimAnez) and by disgruntled rightist xlitazy-civilian roup within the country who favor a return to authoritarian government. Amouig the most publicized of these attempts were the following: an April 1960 invasion through TAehira State and plot for a nation-wide military uprising launched by exiled General Jesfs X. Castro Le6n, former Defense Minister, which quickly collapsed in the face of determined militazy reaction and widespread civilian resistance; the June 1960 assassination attempt against President Betancourt, organized with Dominican Republc Government support by exiled Venezuelan 1Il.itary officers, which nearly succeeded; and a late June 1961 rebellion of part of the arW garrisons * . - ., _ . . : :..* . y>:
-6- in Barcelona and a handful of National Guard officers and men in the area sup- ported by civilian groups Including several URD elements, which collapsed in the face of immediate militar7 and government counter measures. By prompt and decisive action against plotters the Betancourt government has appreciabl2y strengthened its position with the armed forces and the population at large during the past two and a half years. Although plotting can be expected to continue among dissatisfied rightist militar7-civilian groups and exiles, it seems apparent that these elements alone do not have sufficient strength to overthrow the government. Most military officers not only regard the Betancourt administration as the best available alternative to an extremist leftist form of government, but they also reportedly endorse the view that the proper func- tion of the armed forces should be to serve as an apolitical am for the'defense of the nation and its legally constituted institutions. Over the long run an equivalent threat of subversion is presented by the opposition grouping formed in mid-1960 by extreme leftist political factions including the PCV, radical elements of the URD, and the Marxist-oriented Move- ment of the Revolutionary Left (Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria - MIR). Beginning in September 1959 the kCf%ecame increasingly critical of Betancourt Is coalition government, modifying its earlier unity-at-ayr-price approach of avoiding extreme demands and actions, and in subsequent months PCV agitators participated in several public disturbances. In mid-196O, frustrated in its efforts to improve its political position, the PCV announced a policy of militant opposition to the Betancourt regime. The PCV was joined in this role by the MIR, which was organized in mid 1960 by a dissident political group ex- pelled from the AD in April 190 for advocating a radical policy line for that party in contravention of the AD's moderate leadership. Extremist URD elements, dissatisfied with their party's policy of supporting the coalition government, also allied with the PCV-MIR opposition. These three groups helped to promote a series of violent student-extremist riots in October and again in late Novem- ber and early December 1960, which pceed a strong threat to governmental stability. Order was finally restored through effective police and military action, while an en-suing campaign of suppcrt for the government and constitu- tional practices promoted by responsible sectors of public opinion tended to discredit the opposition parties and pro-Castro forces in Venezuela. Never- theless, in mdd-November the URD withdrew from the ccalition and formally joined the opposition. As consequence, the party was beset by internal dissen- sion between an extremist faction advocating continuing violent anti-government action and a moderate faction led by the party leadership which favored a non- violent strategy designed to force government implementation of a radical program of socio-economic reform. TCoaltion of In 1960, the President was forced to reorganize his coalition govermpyt to Include only members of his AD party, the COPSI, and political independents. f While
I- While retaining a majority of the membership, the coalition parties# position in the Congress was weakened as a result of the XNR split off from the AD and the MID withdrawal from the coalition. In additionj PCV-IR-U0 slates won a series of Important trade union elections throughout the country during the latter part of 1960, but after February 1961 AD reversed this trend. The MIR defection and IR-PCV-U= election victories in student organizations at the university and secondar level during 1960 and 1961 effectively displaced AD from its former primary position in the organized student movement and, indeed, COPEI is presently the most important non-extremist political group active among students. Power of Btreme Left D To counter the threat to governmental etability represented by the extrem- * Let opposition, the Betancourt administration has adopted a series of political measures designed to lessen the popular appeal of this group and to curtail its ability to promote violent disturbances of the public order. Under the terms of a suspension of certain constitutional liberties which was instituted at the time of the November-December 1960 disorders and is still in effect, a general - policy of harassment against these groups has been followed for the past several months. Newspapers and other propaganda organs of the MIR and PCV have been banned from circulation on the grounds that they tend to incite subversion, and agitators from these parties and the URD have been periodically arrested by the police. The offices of the PCV and MIR in several points of the country have been raided frequently by the authorities in search of incriminating material, and in public statements spokesmen fcr the government parties and responsible supporting groups in the society have repeatedly condemned the extremist opposi- tion as irresponsible and inclined to subversicn, In the labor movement, the AD has followed a vigorous and so far successful policy during the past half year seeking to isolate and destroy the influence of the KIR-PCV-URD combination * in labor unions and looking toward an early epulion of leaders of this grou : from key positions in the national- Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (Co. federaci6n de Trabaladores de Venezuela - CTV) and its affiliates. In 265 trade union elections in the period February-October 1961 AD won 215 victories. In student xatters, the Betancourt government has recognized the danger arising from extremist leftist predominance and AD weakness and has initiated action to undercut the MIR-PC-U=D position. A vigorous AD Minister of Education was ap- * pointed early in 1961 and he has been weeding out Ccm nst-oriented supervisor7 personnel from the secondary school system. AD student leaders have begun a recruitment and reorganization drive ml versity ztudents, which is show- ing some signs of success.

They have persistently called for a remdeling of the gavernmeat's refom program according to the pattern followed by the Castro regime in Oiba. Three groups have based their violent attacks and action against the Betancourt goverment on this issue and on the claim that only by replacing the present moderate leftist regime with a "populist" govermet can the Venezaelan people realistically expect to achieve the standard of living and progres- sive national development to which they aspire. On the other hand, repre- sentatives of conservative business interests and of certain ndholding groups have criticized the government's reform proam as too radical in certainrespects, wasteful and inefficient in its impl3eentation, and politically motivated in that it caters excessively to the masses at the expenseprinrily of the conservative and wealthy groups in society.

CRET -9- It has proven to be a major task for the President to secure agreeient among the parties and grous supporting his coalition governent, as well -as the major non-political groups in the society, to the economic sacrifices involved in the operation of an effective recovery program. Thus, in early 11veaier 1960 President Betancourt suspended foreign exchange operations preparatory to devaluing the bolivar, but he was forced by widespread opposition on the part of business, industry, banking, labor, and political groups (including -EI) to adopt instead exchange controls. In I e 1960, after ovrcing the opposition of several coalition political leaders, the then newly appointed Finance Minister a ced an economic recovery program designed to reduce get deficits, encourage investment, and stimulate the private sector of the econcmy. However, in May 1961 he resigned his position due to obstacles encountered in executing his recuperation plan and 4ifficulties with other cabinet members who opposed his efforts to limit the exditures of the ministries. In early May President Betancour propoe that C6ngress approve an austerity and recovery program envisaging reduction in gove t employee&s- salaries, increases in taxes, reduction in expenditures and p ed efficiency of govermment agencies, and pro- viding investment incentives. This proposal encountered violent opposi- tion on the part of the extreme leftist political parties and was strongly criticized even within the MD and COPEI as well as by influential industry and business groups. On June 29 the Congress approved the program in a modified form which eliminated part of the suggested salary cuts and tax increase., but, in order to insure passage, the AD-OPEI majority had to push through a revision of the rules to permit majority (rather than two-thirds) vote to curtail debate and thereby terminte a PCV-MIR-URD filibuster against the measure.

The Gomez dictatorship effectively forest4lled the development of political parties during the period 1900-1935, 4nd subsequently the armed forces became the dominant political force iq the country with oply two short -nterruptions. Present-day political parties came into being after 1940- -and fron the outset compted -vigorously for leadership ofhe r sing -urban middle and -wqrking" classes.

Intense interparty rivalry before 1948 contributed-to the Instability of representative government and was a factor in the o4er-troy of the 7freely elected civilian administration headed by AD leader Rbtulo Gallegos in November 1948. The subsequent years of common "pposition to -the Perez Jimenez dictatorship motivated a willingness to compfomise on the part of political party leaders, who became increasingly aware of the. problems involved in establishing and nurturing representative govern- ment and of the need -to -nite against -the inrbads of militarism and of supporters of oligarchical rule. This realization was Instrumental in promoting the close cooperation among the parties and non-political civic groups that led to the overthrow of Perez Jimenez in January 1958. );mociratic Action. *. Venezuela's largest political party, was orgamzed' omuÂ±o etancourt and a number of distinguished -ovelists, teachers, and professional men. Betancourt -was its key figure and driving force from the beginning, and under his leadership AD became the proto- type for Venezuela's other non-communist parties. It-was organized * clandestinely in 1937 and gained legal status in 1941. From 1911 to 1945 AD rapidly developed its party structure and propaganda activity and ef- fectively mobilized popular support, and through its control over govern.. ment in 1945-1948 AD became the majority party in the country. Persecuted by the Perez Jimenez government, AD operated on a clandestine basis and cooperated effectively with other opposition groups during the period leading up to the dictator's overthrow. Betancourt was an early member of the Communist Party of Costa Rica during his years of political exile in the early 1930's, but he soon re- nounced his membership and has since been one of the foremosL anti- comunist political leaders in Latin America. Under his leadership AD has f long been at odds with the Commnists in Venezuela, particularly in labor, student and intellectual spheres. AD at present | n
23.< AD at present has a mebership of close to 8OVW. In the 192 elections AD presidential candidate Betaneourt received 10%*of the vote (2.7 million), and AD won a majority of seats (184,-*t the time) in -both-h-uses -of the Congress, vith 32 representtives -n-te Senate and 73 in the Chamber of Deputies. The effect of the previously mentioned defection of the MMR and the continuing economic difficulties on AD's following is uncertain. AD has a more complete nationwide 6rganization than other Venezuelan parties and, despite its hierarchical nature, Its structure is such as to provide proportional and regional representation of its sources of support. Its support, *hch is based predominantly an urban and rural labor, lies outside the Caracas area. AD is the -wtrong- major party in the urban labor movement and it overwbhemihg1y con- * trols the influential Federation of Landworkers (Federacion de Campesinos), with Its claimed 750#000 members. Despite -thl expulsion of most leftist extremists in m;d-1960m there still -remaln seAious Internal political divisions, chiefly between the nold-guardl followers of Betancourt and the younger generation' of more --leftlst-imeclned leaders who favor a greater nationalistic and socialistic line internally and a more "independentm foreign policy. Nationalistic and socialistic, AD is comparable to the Social Bemo- crats of Western-Europe, the British Labor Party, and the Aprsta Party of Peru. As a social -democratic party, AD is part of -ageneral movement in the area advocating a radical but evolutionary Sesion of the traditional -nstitutions of Latin American society. AID's economic program is nationalistic and emphasizes industrialization and basic socio-economic reforms, urges the broadening of Venezuela's economic base to free the country from dependence on petroleum revenues, and also favors a larger 9hare ror Venezuela of the profits from the petroleum ind&stry. The -party recognizes the Important role of foreign investment capital but advocates Its closer regulation in the national interest and greater participation by government and Venezuelans in the exploitation of national : resources and basic industries* AD's nationalism has the "anti-imperialistic- slant common to other underdeveloped countries and it advocates greater Latin American unity in relations with the United States. AD Assigns to the armed forces an apolitical role limited to national defense, internal security. and the support of constitutional govermment. Because of its leading position . in the governmnt, plays the major role in shaping policy. primarily through * the person of the President. The policies of the present government, bow- ever, reflect certain views more moderate than several points advocated in AD's program and by several of its less moderate elements, such as AD university student leaders.
Jr -22 COPI. The Social Christian Party, is -the Venezuelan version of the interna al Social Cristian -movement. It was organized in 4945 by a group 6T university intellectuals and legalized the folow year. Daring the next two years COPEI attracted a sizable follo=in and achieved a firm base for future development. It opposed the AD-domit6ed govern- ments of the period 1945-48 and welcomed GallegosI overthrow tnd replace- ment.-by a military junta. Neverthelese, COPEI shortly b9came thoroughly disillusioned over the repressive aspects of the Pere; Jimenez regime and . developed a clandestine party operation in the period 1948-58 ap the result of government barassment of its operation"and leadqrs. It cooperated full7 with the other parties and opposietion groups in activities against Perez Jimenez and, subsequently, in restoring civil liberties and representative government, As indicated earlier, COPEX has* participated from the outset in the coalition government and has vigorously supported President Betancourt against attempted coups by rightist elements and agitation from leftist-extremist groups. COPEI membership is estimated at about 300,000. Its presidential . candidate, Rafael Caldera, received 16% of the vote and COPE1 elected 6 members to the Senate and 19 tot-he Chamber of Deputies. There have been no reliable devices since the election by which to determine whether COPEI's strength of following has changed. - However, it is unlikely that this following has increased. Since the MIR defection from AD and the URD withdrawal from the coalition COPEI has assumed an increasingly important place in the Venezuelan Government, representing a moderate political force second only to the AD. Its role in student circles has also expanded in a corresponding fashion, particularly as.a result of AD's. interest in com- 'bating-the inroads of extremist opposition groups in these sectors. COPEI draws its support from all levels of society but is strongest among .practicing Catholics in the middle class, organized labor, and the rural population, particularly in the Western Andean region. Its most Important personality is Rafael Caldera, currently President of the Chamber of Deputies, and its leaders are largely professional men, principally doctors, lawyers, journalists, *and teachers. Although the most moderate or centrist of the major parties, COPKL claims a left-of-center position defined as revolutionary, nationalivtic, democratic, and'popular. The party stresses that it is not Church-come,-ted and that it is open to all who * will accept its ideological position on Christian motivation. social goals, and democratic methods. Nevertheless, ODPEI is popularly regarded as the Church party, and its program shows Church influence in emphasizing the primacy of the individual and farily, in its support for private education * and'extensive social welfare, and in its opposition to establishing diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R. In most respects, however, COMI*s program is'very similar to that of AD and, like other parties, it professedly disap- proves of an intimate Church-State relationship.

In As early --Wars uRD was not a significant force and attracted onl,. 'aboyt 4% of the electorate. Following the demise of the Gallegos government in 948 and the ensuing suppression of AD under Perez Jimenez, URD expanded rapidly. In the 1952 constitutional assembly elections called by the Perez.

Under the succeeding Junta Government URD reorganized .its party organi- zation and, profiting from the prestige of its presidential candidate Junta President Wolfgang Larrazabal (who was not a URD member), won second place in the elections of 1958 with 35% of the total vote. In the legislative contest URD elected 11 senators and 34 deputies to the Congress. As previously described, URD participated in the coalition government with AD and COPE until November 1960, when it withdrew and joined the opposition in cooperation with MIR and PCV. lURD mow has an estimated membership of over 300,000. Although it lacks -the organization-strength of the other parties, its. ideological vagueness attracts a large independent vote when it has a popular candidate, as was the case in the 1958 presidential elections. Membership is drawn from all elements or society, with the largest numbers from the middle -and lower classes. URD strength is small among industrial labor and rural, Student, -nd professional gromps, but in 1958 election campaign it relied more -beavly than other parties on the less highly organized groups such as artisans, small businessmen, and shantytown dwellers concentrated in the Caracas area. It is believed to have lost membership since the 1958 elections, because of a. controversy within the party over the question -of -participating in the coalition government, which was aggravated by the decision to join the opposition. The least doctrinaire and homongeneous party in Venezuela, URD is commonly characterized as an opportunistic alliance of political leaders intent on reaching public office. Its leadership also includes a radical wing that follows an avowedly pro-Castro line. URD ideology is extremely fluid and does not have the written precision of the other major parties. It is nationalistic, favors a democratic, reformist government, and supports ongressional predoinance over the executive, a high degree. of local autoniy, and representation of all parties in the highest 5 couils of the gov rnent. Although its economic and social. pogram, _ *.. ......, ,.
emphasizing industrialization and agrarian reform, is simil4r to that of AD and OFPEI, as noted above it is posed in a omore -radical Tonm and has been voiced -ecently -in terms of urging Castro-type solutions -for jenezuelan social and economic malajustments. URD opposes the anti-gommunist, anti- Soviet, and anti-Castro postures of the Betancourt administratioN and is strongly critical at times of the latter's cordial relations with the United Statesb In recentmthe the moderate leadership of the URD has seemed to gain in strength at the expense of the radicai element, and there are indications -that -the party is seriously reappraising its policy of extreme opposition to the present goverment. This change is motivated in part ,by the failure of t4e extremist-promoted anti-government demonstrations of November-Ibcember 1960 and by the reluctance of many party figures to continue being excluded from the benefits of the government patronage system which favors coalition supporters. The Venezuelan Communist Party ranks aTong the largest Communist parties in Latin America and is the oldest of modern Venezuelan political parties. Organized in March 1931, it has operated as a clandestine organization d rinmg most of its existence and until 1952 was weakened by splits and dissension. Although outlawed by the Perez Jimenez regime in 1950, the PCY was not harassed as was the AD, and was able to place several of its leaders and sympathizers in high positions in the government. As a result, the largely intact &V organization rapidly resumed overt operations once it was legalized again in 1958. Following the dictator's ouster, the vide- spread civilian support of political unity against authoritarian govern- ment permitted the PC7 to associate itself with the dominant nationalist and anti-imperialist currents of Venezuelan opinion. As indicated above, at "-the outset it sought unity with other parties and supported the coalition -gcvernment established by President Betancourt in February 1959; however, it announced a policy of militant opposition to the government in mid-1960. MC dues-paying membership increased from a skeleton cadre of about ,000 militants in late 1957 to an estimated 50,000 in late 1958. 'The Party-received only about 85,000 votes out of 2.7 million in the -presidential elections and about 161,000 votes out of close to 2.6 million in the congressional elections in 1958, placing 2 members in the Senate and 7 in the Chamber of Deputies. PCV membership rests largely with labor and youth (primarily student) groups and, somewhat less, with teachers, journalists, and intellectuals. Its strength is greatest in -the Federal District%and the oilfields. In large part as result of the failure of the opposition's attempt to overthrow the Batancourt government in late 1960, the PCV was considerably discredited and is believed to have suffered a reduction in its membership to about 35,000 at present including its closely integrated'youth organization which represents perhaps 40% of the Party's strength. The PCV's gIo ..
The PCV's announcd program had been only somewhat more extreme and more nationalistic mnd *anti-imperialisticM than the 1958 platforms of other Venezuelan parties but as it became more openly oppositionist in 1960 it more clearl7 espoused the customary line of international C NuPGOP PCV t=aUcs correspond in general to those of other Latin Amrican prties. Its major short-ran objectives are to secure Venezuelals netrAlity In the East-West struggle, to promote anti-U*Se sentiment in Venezuela by blaIn the country's economic and social troubles on alleged U.S. 4perialism, --to encoage moves for a takeover of the oil industry by the Venezuelan -government and pivate c.mpanies, and to favor adoption of a Cuban-style revolutionary reform program. The Movement of the 'Revolutionary Left is the most vocal and aggressive of the Unor Venezuelan parties. As indicated above, it waa orgai4zed In wid-960 -y -a group of 7oung politicians expelled from the AD over their disagreement-vith policies of AD moderate leaders, -vhom they accused of having abandoned the party's historical materialism" and neglected to promote necessary social and economic reforms. MIR's main spokesman is Congressman Domingo Alberto Rangel, former AD National Pblitical% Secretary, and its leadership includes one senator and 15 deputies, all of whom were formerly associated with AD. MIR has attracted extremist leftists and radical Marxists and has apparently received an influx of Communist student and labor leaders. Its main area of influence is the Federal District and eastern Venezuela. However, an accurate indication of MIR size and influence with the voters must await the elections of 196, but its main sources of strength are not likely to be substantially different than at present. The party claims to -represent the workers and exploited classes and advocates a national * liberation movement modeled after the Cuban regime of Fidel Castro to replace "the present government. As stated previously, in recent months the MIR in alliance with the PCV and URD won a series of important student . organization elections and made important gains in the labor union movement daw img late 1960, both of which situations the AD government is presently seeking succe.ssfull to reverse. In ideological orientation. MIR is a socialistic party advocating "revolutionary Marxism", and its program calls for the nationalization of petroleum and other mineral resources, radical land reform measures, and diplomatic relations with Communist countries., - Other parties. There i' no significant party of the right or center in Venezuela. A newp middle-of-the-road party, Progressive Republican Move- ment (Moviiento Republicano Progresisto. - YRP), came into being in.September 1961 under the leadership of Senator Ramon Escovar Salom. Its platform " includes: a "healthier" petroleum policy, combination of public and private capital but with vell defined responsibilities both in the economy and in . *. -education; guarantees for private investment; permanence of Venezue!a within sphere of Western civilization; efficient administration of agrarian reform; respect for Christian sentiment the Catholic Church and for religious freedom; a strong army; and condemnation of war and nuclear testing. Escovr stte ''.. E -?

ARP disagrees with th, methods of the Cuban Revolution but rejects intervention in Cuba. *NRP has incorporated into its rolls the limited following of the extinct Socialist Workers Party* There is also a small party the Venezuelan Socialist Party "(Partido Socialista Venezolano- , which has no significant influence" ostrength. I I- . g5
Or&anized Labor The Venezuelan work force is estimated at 2,600,00 or 35% of the popula- tion and is distributed about 6% in urban occupations, 2% in extractive industries and 8% in agriculture. The annual incr#- ent approximates 85,000. Unemployment has been rising steadily since 1958 and is largely concen- trated in vrban areas, especially Caracas. Rural-to-urban migration# low worker skll levelp and the current economic drift appear to be the principal factors contributing to unemployment. Government 'gram for worker skM traininp agrArian reform, industrial diversification and public works have had only limited effect to date in reducing unemployment. Venezuela has a comprehensive labor code which sets nimum standards for working conditions, provides fill freedom to organize unions for all workers except ciil sdrvants and recognizes the right t6 strike. "! Social security benefits are limited to medical care for workers and their families although the legislation contemplates eventual coverage of old age and unemployment risks. There is no minimum wage legislation, and collective bargaining is the usual instrument for setting wage levels. Collective bargaining on an industry- wide and plant basis is highly developed. Wage levels tend to be higher than those in other Latin American countries, and fringe benefits are more costly and extensive than those provided in the U.S. The labor movement is well organized, and its structure closely resembles ' that of the AFL-CIO. There are 23 state federations of labor and 12 industIial federations which are members of the central, labor organization, the Confedera- tion of -Labor of Venezuela. The confederation claims 1,300,000 members, inciud- ing 550,000 urban workers and 750,000 landworkers. The labor movement is strongly influenced by political oarties, with the Accion Democratica (Free. Betancourt' s party) faction controllinig about 60-70% of the unions and almost all* of the state and industrial Xederat ions. The AD has made great progress during 1961 in reducing Communst influence in the labor movement and has won control of key unions and federations which were formerly under Communist * domination. Until late 1961, the Confederation represented all of the political fac- * tions (COM# AD, Conmdnists, MIR, URD). Hoever, the Comnunists were suocess- * ively forced out of key Confederation offices during 1961; and, in December, the Confederation split in two parts with AD-COPE] and about 75% of the movement remainingwithin the Confederation and the Communists with MIR and UM moving to set up a rival labor organization. Management j .Ck
-38- Management Organizations A complex of management organizations has evolved since 1945, when an overall national association, the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers and Associ- ation of Commrce and Production (Federaci6n Venezolana do C&naras Z Asociaciones de Comercio Z Producci6n - FEDCAE. was formed. The membership of fDECAM, numbering over 100 affiliates, includes all significant agricultural, comercial, and industrial associations in the country. The recent increase in associations representing the economic community has strengthened the political influence of the conservative sector of society which lacks political party affiliation. ECAME has served as'an effective channel between the economic comimmity and the government since Januar7 1958# and it currently maintains formal liaisen with the government through a joint committee with membership of cabinet members, FEDECAME directors, and others. In addition, the commercial, industrial and professional sectors at present have direct access to high government circles since several members of the cabinet are associated with these groups and, in fact, a majority of cabinet members are political independents. The Armed Forces Militar7 influence has been appreciably reduced since the Pfrez Jim6nez overthrow, partly because of the opprobrium attached to the a rmed forces for having supported the dictator and partly because of the rapid growth in influence of the political parties and other major groups in the society. In the context of widespread support for constitutional government and opposition to author- itarianism thoughout the country, the armed forces almost exclusively have assumed the role of the defender of civilian government against internal subver- sion and interference from neighboring countries such as Castro's Cuba and Rafael Trujillo's Dominican Republic. Armed forces activities as a pressure group have concentrated primarily on promoting the professional needs of the military establishment. The present military top command and the majority .of the officer corps reportedly approve of this approach, while most of those opposing it have been exiled. The armed forces, however, continue as potentially the single most influential and decisive force in the country, and the military would almost certainly adopt a mare active role should extremist leftist forces succeed in removing President Betancourt from the scene or overthrowing his *. government. Tt is also possible that the armed forces would be persuaded of the necessity to intervene directly in governmental direction should the Betancourt administration show dangerous incapacity to control public order *or .be unable to reverse the current economic recession. The Church Since colonial times religion has generally lacked significant influence in Venezuela and, even though the Catholic Church claims the affiliation of , 96%'of the population, Venezuelan society has traditionally been characterized by strong
- 19- by strong materialims religious apathys and at times by vigorous anti- clericalim. State control over Church matters aa relegated the Corch almost to the role of a government agenq. The clerg is discouraged by the Church and popular prejudice from participating in political aUvites and seeking public offices and the Church is professedly apolitical except for its strong hostility to Comunim. In recent years Church nluence hs increased somewhat as a result of its active espousal of a social reform pro A, its open opposition to Pirez Jim inez and the role it played in his overthrow, its general support of the liberal policies of the present. , government, and the namng of Venezuela's first. cardinal in December 1960. The Student Movement Students in Veqezuela, as elsewhere in Latin America, constitute an important pressure group and, through participation in youth wings of the major parties and demonstrations for, or against given policies, are in a position to exert significant influence on the government. Venezuelan students are organized politically at the secondary and university level throughout the country, and the PCV4MR-bD opposition alliance has emerged as the strongest force on campus with the collapse of the AD student organ- ization following the MIR defection from AD. The latest manifestation of extremist influence in the university student movement was the violent demonstration organized on a moment's noticp against the American Ambassador * by students at Central University in Caracas in June 1961. AD and government preoccupation over the exremist drift in student matters has been reflected in efforts to remedt this situation by replacing extremist elements and seek- ing to rebuild AD student strength. Comunii In the past the Commnist Party of Venezu#la (Partido Comunista de Venezuela - PCV) has not posed a serious threat to the political orders,. and it still lacks the capability to seize power by its own resources. Nevertheless, since the overthrow of the Pgrez Jim6nez regime - in which the Communists played an active role - PCV capabilities have increased and - :in cooperation with the KE and UMD - it now possesses a strong potential for subversion. Its youth wing constitutes a powerful political force which - with the MIR and URD c- controls the principal university and secondary school student organizations; C unists are in virtual control of the Venezuelan * Newspapermen's Association; and in organized labor the PCW is second, but a poor second, to AD in strength. However, in all of these sectors the Cmunits are facing determined opposition by AD-COI elements. - The PCW has reportedly penetrated the areq officer corps at the compwW grade level, and in addition maintains a small paramilitary organization comprised of party militants. * I( .The PCV
The Pff -i n cooperation with the XR and elements of the MD - mad. a major effort to overthrow the goverment In the disturbances of October-Bovmber 1960. The Comists, particularly the local leadership and rank and files were apparently surprised and demoralized by the promptness and effectiveness of the government's camtermeasures, under a partial suspension of constitutional guaranteesas well as by the lack of popular response to PCV appeals. Although the party has been permitted to retain its legal statuss the communist press has been closed, some second-string leaders have been Imprisoned, and the PCf has remained subject to periodic harassment by the government. To date the nine Comumnists in the National Co ress have continued to enjoy mmunity-from arrest, but the Betancourt administration is seeing to revoke the Immnit at certain comunist congressen in order to try thM for subversion. Comist efforts to convert VenezueLan reaction to the Cuban Invasion into large-ale anti-government demonstrations in April resulted in a further crackdown on party activities. Under the circumstances which have prevailed since Novem- ber 1960, there has been not only a sharp drop in membershipp but a noticeable absence of militancy among the reminng m mbers and a reluctance by Communists and sympathizers alike to contribute to the financial support of the party. In this situation the Communists in Venezuela have directed their main efforts to organization, preparations for possible outlawing of the party and clandestine propagandizing on a moderate scale. Partly. because they have lost their propaganda organs and because they have tried to avoid further blows from the Government, the Ccmmiunists largely stood out of the limelight until the Venezuelan break with ,Cuba when they tried to mount protest demnstrations. These were put dawn by the government without azW major difficulties devel.pig. The commmist leadership may hope that the right-wing opposition wl attempt to seize power, forcing the government to turn for 9#pport to the PCV-IR-UW coalition. The strategy shift was foreshadowed at the Third National Congress * of the PCV, held in Caracas, March 10-16, 1961. Although the congress - which confirmed in office the established party leadership - was held openly and was attended by delegates from all parts of the country, it has received little publicity either in Venezuela or in the international communist press. The Congress called for 1) continued close cooperation with the KR and some elements of URD, 2) continued agitation for more rapid and radical socio-econamic reform along Cuban lines, 3) greater attention to agrarian matters, 4) a major but unpublicized recruitment g n, and 5) expansion of the party's 14lied paramIlitary apparatus. The PCV, like the other communist organizations in Latin America, has been greatly encouraged and inspired by the success of the Commnists in Cuba, and until recently openly advocated a Castro-style revolution in Venezuela. Although the T~W secretary general has stated publIcl that Venezbla does not want Fidel Castroim, he confi that Venezuela will profit by Fidel Castro's * experience. The influence of the Cuban example is evident in the PC's pro- posals for industrial and agrarian reforn in Venezuela. A major I " " I!
A uMj4 weakness of the coramist movement I Venezuela is the lack of a broarural foowing. m leaders have ako ed this ad - a wthe effectiveness of AD-COP competition - among the rural Lion by. calling for a nosh greater concentration of effort on agrarian probles. The part faithful have been urged to devote their energies to a quiet recruituent and infiltration capl gamong existing social organisations c all typee, but with particular fphasis on agrarian refom organirations and the AD-doulnted Venesuen Peasants Federatiou (Federatifi de . de Ceeela do ymr). Comunlsts and oemnmist youth mebers have been sent into outlying areas to enco the peasants to sele lands not legally available for distribution. In this w the CI'unisto hope to identify the PCF with peasmat aspirations iobstructing the government's agrarian reform programn. Thof Castro-cnwdem, in Venezuela Venezuelan opinion has been sharply split on the Issue of Castro-cammm, during the past year and a half, In contrast to the pre-19W period when publc opinion was strongly in favor of Castro and the Cuban Revolution. Sentiment regarding Castro-commism is largely determined ty political party sympathy or affilition, and pro-Castro activity is now limited to the extreme leftist PCV-R-UM opposition. As previously stated# this group advocates the replace- ment of the Betancourt administration by a Castro-type regsie and the 4mplemen- tation of radical socio-economic measures modeled on the recent Cuban experience. A significant percentage of.student, teachers, intellectuals, and working level , employees of the press ard other commuications media, were regarded as strong pro-Casiro supporters as of late 1960, but Castroist strength among these groups has reportedly snce waned. The most s1gaificant anti-Castro forces are the AD And COPMv, armed forces# Catholic Church, and a majority of organised labor. An estimated 60% of urban workers, and moch larger percentages of I organised farm workers, c=mecal& bakIdU and industrial Interests, the govement, bureaucracra and the o ers and directors of press and me =mwca- tins media are also opposed to Castro. Castro-cowmisam has so far failed to make appreciable headway awmag peasant orgaizatione in Venrzuela, since a majrIty of the rural population suppOrto the Betanourt admin4stration and is politically identified with AD through the Federation of Landworkers. Relations between the Castro and Betancourt Goerymet , whch were never ood, were broken -in Noea 1961 on the initiative of the Venezuelan GU'ervmen. Underlyin reasons for the break included Veezuelan resentment over statements of Cuban efficials on the need to export the Castro ev t to other Latin American contrless the actIvitUs of Cuban d,plo- and other C in s of Fc-MM-..M agitUatin and the Incre ing"y vitritoli Cuban attacks on Presideut etancor and other high Vene"un offi4eldom. SThe rbur'e .1( I
* - - 22 - The rupture might have come much sooner had the Cuban Government permitted safe condbct to the 47 Cubans who were under asylum in the Venezuelan Fqbassay in Habana. After Venezuela arranged to have these asylees turned over to the Mexican Embassy, whose government assumed charge of Venezuelan affairs in Cuba, relations were immediately broken. There was little doubt in President Betancourt's mind that Venezuelan public opinion would support his decision since Venezuela had become thoroughly repelled by the Cuban executions,. mass imprisonments, disregard for human freedom and life and its other totalitarian activities. The Venezuelan Government's official position now is that the activities of the Cuban Government have disturbed the political peace of the Hemisphere and have threatened its democratic stability; that the character of the Cuban Government is a negation of democracy and, therefore, contrary to the basic principles of the Organization of American States (OAS) and that the Cuban executions and other atrocities are repugnant to the American conscience. While the Venezuelan Government opposes unilateral intervention of arW Amercamn country in Cuba, .it feels that Cuban violation of human rights and that government's connection with the Communist bloc require that the problem be considered at the earliest moment by appropriate organs of the OAS. Venezuela, therefore, fully supports the Colombian initiative on Cuba. The anti-Castro forces are estimated to include 70%-75% of the politically articulate population of Venezuela. Castro-communism will probably continue to be a factor in the Venezuelan political picture for the next 1-2 years, and it will have growing significance should the BetMcourt administration be unable to overcome the current economic recession and to mplement its four-year economic and social reform program. For the longer term, should the Betancourt government succeed in implementing * its reform irogram, Castroism will probably decline rapidly in importance in Venezuela. I .1(1 I..7
7- T m PM)TIS VISIT 70 VENEMICA AND L(I December, 19612 Backgound Papero Venezuelan Forein Relations and Foreign PolieY Ob e aiv.s SuzY of ForeIn Relations The foreign relations of the present Venezuelan government are closely related to and largely determined by domestic realities and policies. Sine petrolem is the prime factor-in the econamr and the chief source of govern- ment revenue, relations are particularly close with the United States, the country's principal export and import market. Venezuela's close ties with the United States are also motivated by the traditional friendship between the two countries, general agreement on economic policies, and anti-Comunist objectives. This relationship and Venezuelan Government antipathy tokvxd the c Soviet Union have been demonstrated frequently in the United Nations and the- - Organization of American States. However, the present Venezuelan government, responding to the view of political party leaders that the country should fol- low a more independent foreign policy, has carefully avoided ar to be depdent on the United States in its foreign policy decisions. Relations with other Western Hemisphere countries have varied according to the political orientation of governments in Venezuela and elsewhere in latin America. Under the AD governments of 1945-1948 and since I [.-(ee-!ab3s.re. tions have been based upon the championing of the cause of repreentative government and repudiation of authoritarian regimes. Under President Betancourt close ties have been fostered with Latin gmerican goverraens and leaders of like-minded political orientation, such as Colombia under President leras Camargo, Bolivia under President Paz Estenssoro, and Costa Rica. The present government is strongly opposed to Latin American dictatorships, as exeml- fied by its attitude toward the Dominican Republic government of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Since the assassination of the latter in late May 1961, the Betancourt government has followed a cautious course with regard to devepp- Ments, firmly opposing the lifting of sanctions while remnants of the Trujillo famiy were still in positions of power. Venezuela has broken diplomatic rels- tions with Cuba and has not recognUed the El Salvador provisional goverment.A Venezuela has generally been on cordial, though not close, terms with Western European countries, especially with France, Italy, and Spain.

Mid But Unbalanced Develoment In part, because of the rapidity of growth, there is now a wide gp be- tween the high-speed, complex organization of the chief urban centers and the slow progress or the smaller eities. More striking even is the contrast between the modern sector of the economy and much of the rural area, which is backward even in a pre-industrial context. From the centers of economic growth in the main cities, change has filtered down only slowly and haphazard- ly to the rest of the country. For many change has come through migration to urban centers which have been absorbing an ever larger proportion of the grow- ing population. The origin and distribution of Venezuelan national income reflects the econom's dependence upon petroleum, its high degree of centralization, the lag in the agricultural sector and provincial areas, and the low economic status of the mass of the population. In 1959 the agricu" l*ral labor force (34% of the total) generated only about 6% of the gross domestic product whereas the petroleum industry (under 2% of the labor force) generated 29%. According to estimates, about one-tenth of the families in Venezuela received 50% of the total private income in 1957 whereas nearly half of the families received about one-tenth of the total. In the same year Caracas, with about one-fifth of the population, took 40% of total private income. The Venezuelan gross domestic product, which was less than Bs. 7,000 . million in 1943 (at 1957 prices), increased to Bs. 12,728 million in 1950 and to Bs. 26,100 million in 1959. During the 1950's the period of most rapid increase, there was a per capita rise of about 40% in the gross domestic * product. In the non-petroleum sector, rapid growth occurred in iron ore iin- * ing, manufactures, commerce, electric power, and construction. Petroleum maintain, its dominant position, contributing 29% in 1959 as compared to 33% by agriculture, manufactures and commerce combined. During 1950-58 Venezuelan gross investment averaged 30% of GNP, a very high rate by comparison with neighboring countries, and about one-third above the US rate in the same period. About one-quarter of this amount represented investment by the foreign-owned petroleum and mining industries. The remainder, or more than 20% of GP, was devoted to investment in economic sectors that are oriented primarily to the domestic market. The government accounted for almost three-fifths of the latter investment, or about 13% of GNP. Gross fixed investment rose from Bes. 2,756 million in 1950 to Bs. 5,964 million in 1958s, and averaged Bs. 4,906 million during the period. Govement investments have been heavily concentrated in basic economic overhead (transport, power, communications) and urban social services (housing and city development). During the period 1950-57 the*emphasis of public investment was on large-cale construction, including low priority and luxury projects,

Bilie 198teemphasis has been shifted to are"s other than Caracas and Nzaab and to smaller scale projectsm parly in an effort to pudh economic dovelop-" ment in neglected area and also to relieve u ployment;In the amodity- producing sectors - industr7 and agriculture - the response of output to government investment has been xelatively low, either because the projects were poorly designed or because, as in the case of the government steel m I In the Guayana Highands the plant has . just) cor into production. Foreiip invest- ment has centered in petroleum and mining (about 90% of total foreign invest- ment), although relatively important in construction, manufacturing, and cowerce. Venezuelan private investment predominates in commmrce,, housing, and services, which account for two-thirds of all investments by local capitalists. Petrolem and manufactures have been the most dynamic sectors in terms of increased pro- duction from additional investment. The Venezuelan revenue system is centralized in the national goverment which draws about three-fifths of its receipts from the:petroloum industry in taxes on production and income. The remaining national revenues are chiefl y derived from customs duties and excise taxes and from income taxes on the non- petroleum sector. Government revenues, as they have kept pace with the rise in petroleum production and GNP, have averaged-close to 25% of GNP in recent years. Both capital investment and current outlay have been financed from the general budget. It is estimated that investments from current income in the public sector, almost wholly by the national government, averaged more than Es. 2,000 million each year during 1957-59 and twt current expenditures for * - .government operations averaged something less than Be. 3,000 millon in the period. In 1950 public sector investment was estimated at Bso 750 million and current expenditures at Bs. 1,380 million. ( ** :... . . - . .*. , .7 ** .,* -
* -6- Foreign Trade Tenezuela's large favorable trade balances over a period of year., sympomatic of.rising export volume and stable prices for petrolem, have permitted imports to increase rapidly without imposing a strain on -the balance of payments. Export earnings avaiLable for the purchase of Amport doubled between 1950 and 1959. The absolute increase in Venizuela's io capacity exceeded that of the rest of Latin America-combined6 as met exporter receipts rose from Bes. 2,409 million in 1950 to Bs. 5,1O million in 1959. The United Statos is the major supplier in the Venezuelan market as well as the largest single outlet for petroleum exports. The United: States position in the Venezuelan market is supported by a reciprocal trade aZreement covering items that made up somewhat less than half the vatue of Venezuelan imports from all sources in 1957. Venezuela in turn hs a substantial market for its petroleum in the United States, shipping irectly or via Arudba and Curacao refineries 45% of its crude and products to this destination in 1960. Protectionist pressures in both Venezuela and the' United States have not basically alterad this relationship. However" the United States quota system introduced in March 1959 has checked the Ioih of petroleum imports from Venezuela as well as from other countries,, and United States exports to Venezuela have been affected by a series of'im- port licensing and exchange control measures, and by increasing Eroean competition. Venezuelan imports from Western Europe rose from 8% of the total in 1952 to 37% in 1959, while Venezuelan direct exports to this area ceclined from 23% of the t,tal to 15% as Europe developed other sources of petroleum supply. The composition of Venezuelan exports has varied little during the past decade, with petroleum and iron ore exports accounting for 95% or more of export values. The major change has occurred through a slight but steady decline in the share of petroleum from 95% to 90% with a comparabLe rise in iron ore exports from 1% to %%. Venezuelan imports changed somewhat during the 1950's as the proportion of consumer goods de- clined and imports of capital goods by the non-petroleum sector increased. Financial problems History of Fiscal Soundness.0 Venezuela's fiscal soundness over most of the past three decades has caused it to be regarded as a solid rock among the shifting sands of its neighbors, despite manifest social problems. High foreign exchange and treasury reserves, free exchange, a stable' mone- tary unit, large foreign trade, and a growing if limited internal market have combiped
-7- have combined to form a rosy picture of stability and easy living. Jhl picture, however, has been shadoied since 1959 by bud4t defIciti =d declining foreign exchange and treasury reserves. lath the faVr at petroleum revenues to continue their previous rise and heavy Lav ad political pressures for increased outlay by the government, the Bea u-t regime has been forced to sk foreign loans, to adopt sowe austeoit*- measures, and to abandon, free exchanpe Following heavy flight of atl which evidenced a general loss of confidm in this fimcial Pbra1taV, the government imposed exc controls in Noyember 1960 to 1 t f r captal 7Might id -to control the -me of freign emch.

Under the system of complete convertibility of the currency, the main control* in the financial system was through expenditure by the government or; conversely, accumulation of. treasury reserves. During 3956-57 the money supply expanded rapidly after heavy payments for petroleum concessions; liquidity of the system was further increased by heavy, although'unrecord C increase in short-terz government indebtedness. Much of the nit-! s was financed by commercial banks granting credits to contractors on fvernmnts' promises to pay. In 1958-59 the governments succeeding the Peres JimecbS regime paid off a large part of this indebtedness from treasur reserves, running a he-vy cash deficit. These operations provided the liquidity for the flight of capital that began in 1959 as a result of a crisis "of con- fidence in the stability of the bolivar. * End of the Boom* To a great extent the crisis beginning in 199 was the by-product of an exaggeration of Venezuela's economic boom broight on by the closing of the Suez Canal in 1956. The threat to NJ East petro- leu- supplies led not only to increases in production and export' for Venezuela but also to a fantastically rapid development program inpolving the prchase of additional concessions and the investment by the foreign oil compA6ies of hundreds of millions of dollars in 19% and 1957. Mhis accelerated rate of development could not of course be maintained. The non-petrozeaw sectors of the economy could not match the accelerated growth and bicame more rather than less dependent upon the petroleum sector for momentm f growth. At the same time the goverrment stepped up its spending's, often for unessential projects, and while accum3Ating treasury reserves, offset these by creating floating debt to pay contractors. Thus the government did not take sufficient steps to shield the domestic economy from the short-lived boom. Legacy of Debt.

It has contracted with aUnited States compa to manage the steel plant started by the Peres Jimenes regime and is combining with the Reynolds Mluminum Company to build an aluminla redaction plant using govern- ment-producta IVdroelectric power in he Ouna a region. The Venezuelan Government hopes to bring about a return to an acceptable rate of economic growth through a program of massive, centrally planned in- vestment.

The Govertment Planniag Agency hopes 'that massive investment In 1962 will enable the government to become relatively self-sufficient financially by 1963; Vdis appears optimistic.
