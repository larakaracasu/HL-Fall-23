g EIJ-Â±.. ONLY- January 1Z, 1965 MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY SUBJECT: Presidential Defense Message A4 ., .. I have two comments on this. The first concerns the alleged comparative strength of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces (page 4). I doubt that the figures represent what they purport to reflect and, therefore, question the utility of the passage. I may be wrong, but the 5 million men under arms we have with our NATO allies includes those contingents stationed in Asia. The Warsaw Pact fi ure does not include such contingents. Therefore, if it remains our purpose to get a stepped-up European ante of conven- tional forces, I wonder whether our case is helped by implying -- albeit incorrectly -- that Western manpower is a half million greater than the communists in Europe. Second, is there any utility, political or otherwise, in supplying the figure of a per cent increase in tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe to support NATO? (Page 3).

I-Ibt- C'. Draft January 12, 1965 PROPOSED PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE ON DEFENSE TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: t.u!h-'ii #-4 A few days ago, I spoke to you on the State of our Federal Union. Today, I wish to report to you on the critical matter of our national defense. While much of the world is nominally at peace, there rerain fires of violence and disorder which are as yet unquenched. There remain in the family of nations those who are willing, if not eager, to impose their own philosophy upon others by resort to force. There remain those Wh.o have demonstrated, more than once, that they will resort to acts of armed aggression to subvert their neighbors' freedom. So long as such conditions prevail in the world, the duty to provide for the common defense of all our people remains a most solemn and pressing obligation of the Congress. Accordingly, I wish both to consider with you the present state of the defenses we have provided, and to offer my recommendations as Commander- in-Chief on our course for the future.

S(( " ._ EYES ONIY THE STATE OF OUR DEFENSES 1. Our country now has at its command the greatest military might ever assembled by any nation. The alliance of free men is today stronger than any possible adversary. We are stronger than any possible combination of adversaries-- and our strength continues to grow. r ]Equally important, there now exists a wider awareness of that power'among our allies and potential adversaries alike. Our own appreciation of our commanding superiority (/ ) " . . " over any possible enemy ha-:also increased. We know -- beyond peradventure -that our strength far exceeds that of our principal adversaries combined and We intend to keep this blance of power.j Our strategic nuclear power on alert is three times what it was four years ago. Our strategic bombers - over half of which can be in the skies en route to their targets within 15 minutes, our land-based ICBM's - protected deep in the earth in their concrete and steel silos, and our POLARIS missiles - deep beneath the sea aboard their nuclear submarines - - I COPY 'I '. r',of 2.'..Uin,,i .T-4 h:v4-, 1l) :.try
ft 3 these diverse weapons form an awesome nuclear armada which can survive any nuclear attack-- however, large or unexpected -- and in retaliation utterly destroy the attacking nation as an organized society. Our tactical nuclear power has increased.' For example, the number of tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe for support of NATO has been raised by! percent. V4 ,.- Wehave enlarged and improved our forces to fight limite war and, with this, our ability to prevent the piecemeal erosion of, the Free World. 1iuing the past four years, we have increased the number of our combat-ready Army divisions by 45 percent. We now have 16 fully equipped active Army Divisions, backed up by 6 high priority Army National Guard divisions. We have added 15, 000 men to the Marine Corps, and now possess three combat- ready, fully equipped active Marine Corps divisions, backed up by a reserve division of improved readiness. These troops can be moved rapidly anywhere on earth by an airlift capacity which is double what it was four years ago today. The firepower of our' tactical Air Force, supporting these divisions, has increased by 100 percent since 1961. S 0 P Y ndo n ai e . Bnes Johnson Libra lrU.
4 Thus, in conventional forces, as well as in nuclear power, our strength is greater than ever before in our peacetime history. The Western Allianoe sgrown until we, together with our NATO al es, now hae more than fi llion -men under arms. The.. r e Warsaw Pact nations including the Armed Forces ), j of the Soviet Union, today total ..wer than four and one-half million. Z. We have, developed this vast strength to support our basic military strategy. It is a strategy of strength and readiness to .3 counter aggression across the entire spectrum of force, from ballistic missiles with their nuclear warheads to bands of guerrillas and their mirdnight terrorism. It is a strategy which permits us to meet force with appropriate force, to confront aggression at any time, in any place, with the will and the means to defeat it. We have achieved such overwhelming nuclear superiority that a nuclear attack launched against us today would be -- as I A / have said -- an act of national suicide on the part of the attacker. But nuclear power alone is not enough. Nuclear weapons alone do not deter all forms of aggression. Indeed, unless nuclear might is accompanied by strong, alert and combat-ready conventional forces, others may be tempted to acts of limited aggression which .COPY I sy nc.. . .o n. ,ti * - o * M l n a * -vQ O, i,on1 Xiin.. .Tohnrn I,ibA.-;ry" -
they believe too small to invite nuclear C =VZnNuclear. pqwer, in short, must be supported by a capacity to respond, flexibly, to situations ranging from conventional war on the Korean model, to guerrilla subversion in Vietnam and elsewhere. We now have the balanced forces necessary to support this strategy of flexible response. We have the combat-ready ground divisions, the airlift to move them, and the tactical aircraft to support them in the field. Our Special Forces, trained for the undeclared, twilight wars of today, have been expanded eight-fold during the past four years. adiness,--r obility, .and.div-3rsit, ou-litary-.forces--have made pheno-66enal advances.} Our great efforts an- xpenditures on major combat forces, including strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, have led our opponents to avoid direct confrontation in favor of ambiguous, in- direct, covert or low-level aggressions. The enemy assassin's knife can be as deadly as his bombs or his bullets. Every day we are challenged to adapt our forces and tactics to master more complex and more subtle forms of conflict.

6J 3. Our military strength is truly usable in assuring our defense and supporting our foreign policy because it is now so managed and so organized that it can be designed and employed with great precision. In these times, the engine of defense must be so harnessed I that its vast power may be unleashed to the exact degree required to meet the threats we face. Four years ago, we introduced an integrated system of planning and budgeting programs, on a continuing five-year basis, for our total military requirements. As a result, the formula- tion of our national strategy, the military force structure, our contingency plans and the Defense budget, are all now related, one to another. The Defens; budget is an integrated plan for building and maintaining the forces we require. We have established an orderly system for informed decision-making which combines the best military judgment in the world with the most advanced scientific and analytical techniques. Today, our entire defense effort is planned, and can be presented to me and to the Congress, as a unified whole. This L y I " L ato Jo n.0 .Lib,,Ary
7 enables us to comprehend more readily the significance of the and Defense badgetf- reshape continually our forces and programs to meet the shifting requirements of a changing world. This *1 also enables us to work together in -lirminating wasteful duplic .- tion, weeding-out programs which have lost their original promise, and freeing resources for more profitable application in other areas. Thus, we now have the ability and the opportunity to provide and maintain - with the least possible burden to our people - a balanced, flexible military forze, capable of meeting any challenge. Our forces are as versatile as the forms of aggression are various. For aggression may take many forms. Aggression may come in a test of our will to defend Berlin. Aggression may come in the form of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, as we saw in Cuba. Aggression may come in the form of unprovoked attacks against our ships on the high seas, as we saw in the Tonkin Gulf. i. 'In,1O.1:o "Lyivlon t.zinv.-4 To],o j4o.rj | "" -try
8 Aggression may come in the form of criminal terrorism, of externally inspired guerrilla warfare against the people of friendly nations, as we are seeing today in the Republic of Vietnam. In all these places we have demonstrated that we can and will meet force with whatever force is necessary to defend our Allies and our own vital interests,, and yet avoid[e .calating the conflict into dangeous and unknowndimensiAs.- BASIC DEFENSE POLICIES 1. Four years ago, President John F. Kennedy stated co the Congress -3nd the world, "The primary purpose of our arms is peace, not war." That is still their purpose. We are armed, not for conquest, but to insure our own security and to encourage the settlement of international differences by peaceful processes. We are not a militaristic people, and we have long denounced the use of force in pursuit of national ambition, We seek to avoid a nuclear holocaust in which there can be neither victory nor victors. But we are equally resolved ta do whatever must be done to preserve our own freedom and the freedom of our , COPY '*yFnon EtinUs John.;on Libra,rv
- -. Ii ' L friends and our Allies. We shall never again return to a world i. where peaceloving men must stand helpless in the path of those who, heedless of destruction and human suffering, take up war and oppression in pursuit of their own ambitions. r 2. Our Stretegic Retaliatory Forces must remain adequate to deter a nuclear attack on the United States or our Allies.i I To do this, these forces must be able to survive any attack within an enemy's power to launch, and then to retaliate in sufficient force to destroy the attacker. The ability of our forces to do so must be certain and beyond doubt; all who might be tempted must know beyond question that a surprise nuclear attack, no matter how successful, would only insure their own immediate destruction. The force we now have, and those we plan for the future, give us that capability and that certainty. We have today more than 850 land-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, more than 300 nuclear-armed missiles patrolling the seas in our POLARIS submarines, and over 900 strategic bombers, half of which are ready at all times to take off within 15 minutes and fly to their targets. These strategic forces on alert are vastly superior both in number and in quality to thosti of a:y other nation. COPY - FY F .:u1on Lyrl aine.s Ton_ T01 ib.Ary
EVV.""f ........ ri %i :- ' 1 10 Maintaining this wide margin of superiority will not require a continuation of the rapid build-up which has characterized the past few years. The immediate future will be a time for concentrating our resources on further technological improvements, and for continuing our imaginative and vigorous program of Research and Development to make certain that we maintain our advantage. This we shall do, so long as is necessary, at whatever cost is necessary. We are requesting over $300 million to continue our more than billion dollar program for extending the life and improving the capabilities of our B-52 strategic bombers. As part of this program, we will eliminate two squadrons of B-5ZBs, the earliest -- and least effective -- model of this plane. We will continue the development of engines and other systems for advanced aircraft, retaining our option to develop a new manned bomber, should the need arise. We will continue the deployment of the SR-71 strategic reconnaissance aircraft, the world's fastest airplane, which will enter the active forces this year. We will continue installation of the new over -the -horizon radars, giving us almost instantaneous knowledge of ballistic missiles launched for attack. N. L COPY Â£ "" -'inn .iO i lyrr.%r-
Our forces will be further strengthened by the continued deployment of our latest strategic missiles, MINUTEMAN H ahd POLARIS A-3, greatly extending the range, accuracy, and strikihg power of the strategic forces. Procurement of the improved versions of these missiles will continue. The deployment of these new systems of greatly increased effectiveness, is replacing older, more costly, and vulnerable elements of our strategic forces. The older ATLAS and TITAN I missiles will be retired this year. The remainder of the B-47 forces will be phased out during Fiscal Year 1966 in accordance with our previous plans. All this is part of a continuing process. There will always be changes, replacing the old with the new. The major new developments in strategic weapon systems we propose to begin this year are: - A new missile system, the EAUS-, to increase the striking power of our missile carrying nuclear submarines. ,40 S,1DOd The IRQF2E-#& missile will have double the payload of the highly successful POLARIS A-3. The incr.eased accuracy and flexibility of the PRO S will permit its use effectively against a broad' range of possible targets and give added insurance of penetration of enemy defenses.

13 I have already cited the increases achieved during recent years in the strength and mobility of our Army. Navy, Marines, and of the air transport which gets them to the scene of battle and the tactical aircraft which support them there. These forces, furthermore, are now better balanced, better integrated, and under more effective command and control than ever before in the history of our Defense establishment. We shall maintain our present high degree of readiness, and by so doing, continue to face the future without fear. We must further improve our ability to concentrate our power rapidly in a threatened area, so as to halt aggression before it can fully begin. The planned expansion of our airlift and improvement in our sealift, and the increased investments in prepositioned equipment will enable us to move our troops overseas in a matter of days, rather than weeks. To this end, we will: -- Start development of the C-5A Cargo Transport. This extraordinary aircraft heralds a new era of air transportation. It represents a dramatic step forward in the world-wide mobility of our forces and in American leadership in the field of aviation. The C-5A will drastically cut the cost of air transportation.
