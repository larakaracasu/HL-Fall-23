PM4V-13 VISIT OF ASTRALIA1 PAIMV.11INISTVI RMZIES June 1-20- 92D ASF Prime Minister Mezies informed the Secretary at the Mfy 8-90 1962 6ZUS Council Meeting in Canberra that he would visit the United States in June following a trip to London. Since the visit follows soon after the wide-ranging discussions at the ANZ6S Council Meeting, he will probably want to confine the discussions to a relatively narrow range of topics. Foremost among these in the economic effect or. Australia, and possibly political effect as well, of United Kingdom accession to the European Economic Comiunity (EOC). In addition the rIme Minister has indicated he will want to talk about the general situation in Southeast Asia and the Indonesia-Netherlands" dispute over Iest..ew Guinea. From the U.S. side, we have no new topics to discuss other than those already gone over at the ANZUS Council .eetinge we will wish to express gratification at Australia's prompt reaction to our request for a common SPATO front in Thailand and Australia's contribution to the defense of South Viet-Ham, and reiterate our hope that Australia not become too deeply committed in trade with Communist China* with respect to the Common Market there have been two developments, The Secretary of the Australiar; Department of Trade, Dr. Westerman, has just concluded talks with us on the Australian viewpoint. These talks probably hardened the U.S. and Australian positions. Moreover, Menzies himself has initiated a vigorous press and TV campaign in the UK which has not only hardened the Australian position, but will increase domestic political pressures in the UK against Common Market me.mbershipo This could.produce, a crisis in the Commonwealth Economic Conference in September which could seriously split the Commonwealth and the western Worlde Menziesi as a statesman, will wish to avoid a collision course and will be looking for alternative possibilities. To the extent possible consonant with our position on preferences, we want to offer such alternative possibilities in the course of these talks and appeal to Menzies as a statesmaA to avoid the collision course with the UK which is now shaping up. oEicq for Discussion 1. Common Market. Prime Minister Menzies will undoubtedly press the U.S. for a greater accomodation of Australia's views toward maintaining Commonwealth Preferences after United Kingdom entry into the European Common Market. While his remarks may depend in part o. his talks with Prime Minister Macmillan, the gist will probably be that the U.S. strongly encouraged the UK to Join the EBC and consequently the U.S. should be willing to helpprevent injury to Australiats ecoo=W as a result of the U.A. move, The Australians hold that U.K preferences under the ComNwealth are vital to the Australian economy and loss of such preferences would lead to serious economic damage that in turn would create both political and economic problems. They azsL that the EEC accord special arrangements of Indefinite duration for Australian commodities when the U.K. enters the k=* They also ask that the U.S. permit greater access for Australian products I II I I.
602- products to the U.S* market* In particular they hope for a reduction in the U.Se Tariff on wool (see Item 2, below). Our position is that we realize U.K. membership in the M may require transitional arrangements for some Australian productso We are prepared to do what is passible with the Australians, Canadians and New Zealanders in order to make corson cause with them and to seek pragmatic alternative solutions* As for !!reater access to the U.S. market, there in now before Cong;ess a proposal for new trade agreements legislation whicht if enacted, wil permit negotiations on a wide range of products, Including products of particular interest to Australiko Details of t1ustralian and United States poeitions with regard to U.K. accession to the EC vil be found in &xclosure 1o Details of the proposed new trade le latin are in Enclosure 2. 2^ Wool. The United States Imports about 55 percent of its total domestic consuptono wool, and of this Australia supplies about ope-third. A reduction in our tariff on wool offers the most practical means of expanding U.S.-Australian trade, and Australia has long sought such a reduction. In June, 1961 we ai:reed to work for a reduction of approximately 60 percent in our tariff on raw wool, subject to satis- factory reciprocal concessons and legislative authorization. Aswe can make no fim conitment until the outcome of the Trade bxpawion Act is known, we can at the present meeting only assure erle Minister Menzies that the matterul be considered ac soon as possible after congressional action on the Trade Expansion Acta Further deuails concerning the question of wool are contained in k=ncosure 3a 3, Southeast Asia, We are gratified that Australia acted promptly to associate itself with us In deploying military units to Thailand. we believe this action has served the double purpose of reassuring the Thais that SEVO members are prepared to honor their commitments effectively and of helping re-establish acceptable con- ditions for pursuing peaceful negotiations in Laos. We are likewise gratified that Australia has agreed to send up to 30 military instructors to South Viet-am in support of our stand that it is important to demonstrate wide free-world support for the anti-communist effort in that country. The Australian action followed on presentation of U.S. lews by Secretary' Rusk at the AZUS Council :eeting, Ma 9 10, 1962CP It is anticipated that 'rime Minister Menzies will want to review the South- east Asia situation generally, seeking our appraisal of the balance of power and our forecast of comig eventso rossibly he may express concern at the effects and implications of incomplete SEATO solidarity in the deployment of fom-e3 in Thailand,eov, cu 11.o congressionl attitudeso 4. West New Guineao The Australian Coverment's position has shifted since early thGyear from-extreme oppositon to Indonesia's move against the Dutch to reluctant acquiescence In having Indonesia for a neighbor in Papua-Nev Guineao The .ustralians
"62- 3- 7he Australians are in accord vith the Netherlands' insistence on self-determination for the Papuans but also strongly support the idea of a peaceful settlement of the dispute through negotiations, and they welcome U.S. attempts to obtain such a settlemento In general they support the Bunker proposals, We anticipate'no essen-ial point of difference between ,ustralia'a and. our approach to the West New Guinea question. Details of the Australians' and our position are set forth in Enclosure Lo 5. The Secretary may wish to query the Prime Minister on his views as to the future of the Pacific Islands and any thoughts he may have regarding cooperation among the metropolitan powers in meeting the region's problems. It will be recalled that this subject was discussed at a meeting with the Chiefs of Mission of Australia, K.ew zealand and the b.K. on June 1, 1962*

.2 itscndedu0so Positions 1. We should outline for Mr. leses a perspective of the UK entry into the Comon Marlet in the largest po2ltical term.

If tiis confereme is marked an atmos*eze of xeca-indtions no mtter bow it fina2y turns out, it can on2y haew serious and adverse effects for all of us. 2. We shmld thank Kr. bsnzies for the uso,ul and constructive visit of Dr. Westerm. Dr. Wasteman0s detailed explanation of Auxtral:a:s pioblems has helped us greaty in ow undersnHng. Dr. esterman's visit Idicaed clearly that discussion in favor of preernces is bond to raise equally strong objections on car side to tbem. Th is unhelpful in ters of our mutual interest in seeing that satisfactory solutions to botb ourown and Caomoealth trading Yob3e axe achieved. 3. We

Re@m--nded Uo S. Position 1. The prorisios of the proposed Trade E;pansion Act might be out- lined, and the hope esepl that Australia will be prepared to consider the possibilities of tariff negotiations with the United States at the appro- priate tis. 2. The United States =:;,ht outline its position on a number of specific ccwaodity questions in Which A stra3ia has an interest in the U. S. market (as eben in the discussion section). 3. On the general question of preferences, the United States realizes that same existing Cmoemm lth references may have to continue - war a transitioal period after U.K. accession to the EMj hover would hope that U.K. accession will not lead to the creation of new preferences, and that the transitional period for those that remain will be of reas ble, limited duration.
Disoucimsn 1. The proposals for new trade agreements legislation which are now pelaing befwe the Congress (the House X"s and Mean Conmittee approved those on June h by a vote ot 20 to e) will give the dmnistrationew scope for negotiating tariff reductions in several different waps. They would permit n mdtos up to 50 percent, and copplete removal of tariffs (1) on goods wbich are presently d1tiable at not more than 5 percent, (2) c1 i .a grcuta and f products which are not produced in egnificaZA q1atity In the United States, and (3) in negotiation with the EW, on categories of goods of ihich the United States and the E together acouen for 80 percent of free-world exports* The biMl would also permit the eHadation in negottations with the E of duties an agricultural prodtqts not meti the 80 perent test *re the President such action would asuwr the aI --eamxe or expansion of U. S. exports of such p tducts. Duty - xredwtis elatio uncer he bll would be extended to other free world c . The pending bill provides for readjustment a t to f1Ts aid workers advere2y affected by ImWt c="p1it1on: a- an alternative or swpple-ant to tariff Increases or other iuport restrictiono to curb such competition. These provisions will permit negotiations of Wreater scope and on a wider range of products than have previously boee coved Including products of purticular interest to Australis. 2. The follming are the U. S. positions an several specific cemodity qnsstiouu: a. The U.

The U.S. greatly appreciates Australia's decision to provide addi- tional aid to V.et#-Wax in the form of 30 aray personnel to teach jungle war- fare and .village defense. Australia has already provided Viett,an with econ- omic and paramilitary aid (barbed wire, tents, etc.) valued at $2.8 million. We understand that the details of this new Australian vfer, as well as possibilities for further Australl aid, are being coordinated in Saigon with the Vietnarmse and with General Narkins stafo .*i 2. Australials assistance gives further notice of free world support for Viet-Nam's resistance to Co=mnist aggression and'subversion. 3. U.S. aid has enabled the Vietnamese Government to shift to the offensive in the last six months. However, the Viet Cong have sbceen a correspording increase in strength and determination. A longs, increas- ingly intense struggle is probable. Recent isprovcments in Vietnamese .military and civilian Rorales planninf- and implrentation are encouragin. Anticipated Australian Position - . Australia is happy to be. able to inreaeis v assistance to Viet-n .m - and is willing to consider. additional maas r assistance if they are within Australia's capabilities. .- -- " . .. . .- . * 9 55 .-. -. . * . 9 : .. . ..,-...-. - 1 . .. . . _ * -. . . . .- . . . . : . . .- .-.

/- Discussion Statu of Vr In Vet-.9m - The var has increased in intensity over the past few onths. 7,000 Vet Cong were reported killed In action in the first five MonthO of 1962 against nearly 1,700 South Vietnamese military personnel killed in action during the same period. Viet Cong armed attacks are now averaging around 100 per veek, and the Viet Cong have sbo--n the ability and inclination to mount battalion- sized attacks. U.S. assistance in the form of advice, training and logistic support Is beginning to result in the increased efkectiyeness and aggressive- ness of the Vietnamese IArvq. The Vietnumse Governmoant has undertaken an extensive and increasingly successful program of building strategic hazaets. These are fortified ham.- lets to which the Vietnamese rovernrent will provide sqOial services: schools, first-aid, sanitar7 facilities and instruction. The Vietnamese Government now has two extensive "clehr-and-hold" operations under Wy. One is northwest of Saigon, the other Is in a coastal province in Central Viet-Nam. These opera- tions begin with a military seep to rid the area of Viet Cong. The population Is then gathered into strategic hamlets to separate them from the Viet Congo The final stage consists of a program of Social services, defense training, information and agricultural credit. A comm cations network linking SaIgons province and district centers is now complete. It vill soon be extended to the village level and will thus further extend the degree of security through- out the country. The Vietnamese Government Is taking a broad series of actions to persuade *the. peasant ththas a stake in the outtoc;w of ihe vw. Thesq include the crealin qf provincial couicils, farm credit, school construction, public healt? ogai and resettlement of the liarge nwurber of refugees fleeing frou the V Cg *in the hi&laras4 The constivction of strategic hamlets"and traiingbg'i eq;ipping of local "selZ efense forces will further provide identificati6n with the central govermento Prospects for Future Although U.S. aid has enabled, the GWM to shift to-the offensive An the last idx ionti, the Viet Cme have also sbown a corresponding increase "n " strength an& determination. Pence, there is a probablity of a long, 1creas- ingly Intense stroWle.

A 37/1t *Visit of Auctralian PrU MaUiter ftusla Stas thrpugh Taht (to be raisdt the Prime- Yimuteres Initiative) The Prime Yenster is 1kely to raise the question of the application aubmitted by Oantav EpIre Airwy to the M.11 Aeronautics Board (CAD) for perwisaion to serve the United States vla Tahiti and to exre political "d prosibly other reasons wby t.he Prevident awild .-pprave ttw applUtion.9 The Prime Pinister is aware of the fact that th6 CAB has recomeended denUl of the application on the ground that Tahiti is not an Intermediate point on tho zoute Pronted to the Australia carier in the U-Se-Australla Air Transport Serices Agreement and that release of the PrealdentOs dciailon rorcurr1q,, In this reavrtendiatlon to being wi-thhrald perdiing the Prim Phrustrr?s visLL, Rezmmwie- Md esponses The CAB held ful) h"ar ines on tie Qatse caEe at vhich all interested paizties wre represertAd ars express ed their view, Tho Ad inistration has carefully considered t t recom-.-.rJe% CAB deelalon and is of the view that the ne.otiating history of the bilateral agreewrnt does not support the cmt- tentiGr tht AusLralia ta3 t .x right cmfer that &reoent to serve the Inited StaLe v:, Taiti.

-2- The do nos whether or not to approve CAB reombendation that the Qant4s "plieation be denied rests under U.S. tatute with the President. The alternstIves available to him in the pro instance appear to be as flls 1. Apprwo the CAB recomendations Ioe. concur in Its finding that Australia does not have the requisite right or the U.Se-Austra la Air Tramport Services AgareeM t. 2. Dicapprove the CAB recommen dtion Idirect the CAB to grant the authority requested on the groud that the USo. ig obligated by internatioal greement to permit the Australian carrier to operate to the U.S. via Tahiti. (It Is understood that the Juvt1ce Department does not concur In this view.) 3. Disapprov the CAB recomendation and direct the CAB to grant the authority requested on the ground of overriding political eonsIderationse h. Withho2d action on the matter pending U.S.-Australia negotiations in which Austr2lia would wk that the agreement be amended to permit Australian service through TahIti. From the standpaint of VoSo-oAustralla political relations, denial of the Qantai applic*tion m cause anti-U.S, publicity in Australia with over- tones that the U,S. in reneging on an internationcl commitmento Noreover, denial would be uhfortunate coming on top of Australia cMplaint8 ovar the .S. ttitede on Britai pr entry into the Common Market and of other current dificulties with Autrl on such matters as wool tariffs and taxec on wistributed earning of U.S. subsidiaries In Austral a Another factor ic the LIberl- ntry coliti ' margin of but one vote In the Austra2ia Parliment. The Prime Minister will no doubt effectively set forth such consideratiomnamong others (see page 4). On the other hand, spproval of the Qantam application, especially if it wars granted on the bals of oerriding political eosiderations, would not set well w1ith the U.S. eJr transpor indust-y and with the CoMgress which have been especially critical of the U*S. granting aviation rights on polltical grounds and without a fully adequate aviation quid pro quo. South Pacific Air Liums which Is the only U.S. carrier serving Tahitip would be especially critical. Another political facto:- to be considered is that, If the U*.S allow Oantas to serve Tahiti, it has no practieal choice but also to grant sueb rights to the Sem 7mamd carrier, TEAL, both on prounds of the equal status of the two Comomielth countries and of the fact that Tahiti is on a more direct route to the U.S. from New Zealand than from Australia.
