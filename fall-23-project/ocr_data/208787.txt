The proposed target boxes contain three base camps/bi.vouac areas; a supply/ storage area with platform storage; two truck parks; at least 20 personnel bunkers; three medium size structures; over 50 foxholes; three AW positions; and a network of trenches. Visual and photographic recon- naissance has detected more than 30 underground entrances to natural caves and man-made tunnels, indicating extensive underground facilities throughout this area.

The remaining available aircraft will be employed to strike cover targets as well as targets else- where in-country and in Laos. Strikes on these latter targets will provide a resemblance to normal operations thereby providing a credible story for replies to press inquiries. The 41 MENU sorties will strike seven targets each night. Strike areas will De diversified in an effort to avoid establishing a predictable pattern. The strike pattern proposed is as follows: STP, iKE SCHEDULE - SAIGON TIME (EVEN STRIKES EACH NIGHT FOR A TOTAL OF 4iL SORTIES. - TOTs WILL BE BETv;EEN 1900 A.ND 0600). DATE BASE AREA STRIKES 2 - 3 March 609 4 352 3 5 - 6 March 609 4 352 3 4'. All sorties against targets in Cambodia will be prograr-med against preplanned alternate targets in , and strike req,uest messages will so indicate. in the event the operations should be cancelled, release would be made on these alternate targets.
