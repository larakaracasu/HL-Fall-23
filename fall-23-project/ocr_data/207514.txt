POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION FOR THE U.S. WITH RESPECT TO THE CRITICAL SITUATION IN CHINA PROBLEM 1. To assess the critical situation in ChIna in light of current events; and state the critical questions facing the U. S. Government with possible alternative cclurses of action. ANALYSIS 2. a. The broad objectives of current U. S. policy toward China are understood to be: (1) Recognition of the National Government.as the legal government of a sovereign China. (2) China should eliminate, by political agreement, conflict of armed forces within her territories as a Chi- nese responsibility to -the United Nations in ameliorating the threat to world stability and peace. (3) China should undertake steps to broaden the base of the National Government to make it truly repreoenta- tive of the Chinese people in achieving the goal of a united and democratic China. (4) The U. S. Government desires to assist China as she moves toward peace, unity and genuinely democratic government. 1NSC 22 -1- TOP SECRET . . . . .. . . . . . . . . -
(5) The U. S. Government desires to assist China in the development of an effective Army and Navy, so limited in size as not to become an undue burden on the Chinese economy, and to this end maintains advisory missions. This assistance, however, will not extend to direct phr- ticipation in the Chinese civil war. b. On 9 June 1947 the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed the following views: "It is the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that, from the military point of view, carefully planned, se- lective and well-supervised assistance to the National Government, rnder conditions which will assure that this assistance will not be misused, will definitely contrib- ute to United Sta.es security interests. Such assistance should facilitate the military development which appears essential for the unification and stabilization of China. It should enable China more effectively to resist Soviet expansionist efforts in the Far East and will thus con- tribute to the military security of the United States. In addition, it should be a stabilizing factor through- out the Far East. A firm United States position in this regard, as in.th- IMMiddle East and elsewhere in the world, would serve the cause of peace as we.1 as the other aims of the United Nations;,1 q. On 31 March 1948 the Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirmed these views in the following language: "...the situation in Greece emphasizes that economic aid has little value unless and until internal conditions of law and order are established to the degree that the eco- nomic aid will serve the purpose for which intended...it would be unwise to extend economic aid to China without the military assistance which will provide the National Government some means with which to improve the present situation of internal armed conflict...the Joint Chiefs of Staff perceive no objection co the view that the NSC 22 - 2- TOP-SECRET--
_ _Â°" - - ---- - * +ted States assistance proSram in China should be re- -gar4d as sub,rdirate to t-h= efforts to stabilize cond.i- tiouIs in areas o f more strategic importance." d. Authorized U. S. aid to China from V-J. day to the P..esent; exclusive of the surplus property sales, aggregates somewhat over one billion dollars, at least half of which was in the form of military assistance. This aid in part, how- ever, was not administered in a coordinated manner and under an 11. eg-.at,Bd program designed to-effect the optimLm benefit for value received. e. The current intelligence estimate of the situation places th9_Ch1=nere'Co==nJsts in possession of the stretegic initiative. The relative tactical troop strength of the op- posing forces is estimated at 1,350,000 Communists and 2,200,- 000 Nationalists. However, the apparent Nationalist numerical superiority is offset by tha fact that more than half of the[ * *1 Nationalist total are currently isolated in 10 garrison areas in 14anchuria, North China and Central China, and the r*emainder are engaged in attemptIng to maintain the few remaining lines of communication. The Nationalist forces, isolated in a ser- ies of garrison areas or confined in shrinking areas, have no strategic offensive caoability and their defensive capabili- ties are decreasing. The lack of overland lines of co+mmuni- cation I-s placed an increasing burden on an already limited 'S22 3
air supply service upon which the isolated Government concen-& trations are totally dependent, and the local supply situa- tion would remain critical even if adequate supplies were available in rear areas. Isolation and confinement of Na_!" tionalist concentrations has forced the Government to dis- perse supplies and troop strength over widely scattered areas to such an extent that the Nationalists are incapable of con- centrating their efforts in a single area, and isolation of the concentrations precludes mutual support and coordinated effort. Meanwhile, the Communists are directing their ener- gies against strategic areas, the loss of which would ad- versely affect,the Nationalists' l'imited capabilities. In a number of instances the Nationalists have shown a lack of will to resist, but.defection on an alarming scale has not been noted. f.- In the political field the Generalissimo continueb to be the balance of power among the various political cliques and elements striving for power in the Government. The ap- pointment of Wong Wen-hao as Premier indicates that the real administrative power will remain with the Presidenmy and that the Cabinet will function ineffectually. Dr. Wong Wen Hao is the symbol of reform but he is completely powerless at this time when the power'btructure of the Government is being more closely identified with military factions, personality N- - NSC 22 - 4 - TOP- SECRET
relationships, and loyalty factors than with progressive ad- ministrative processes. There is increasing speculation of late that certain separatist movements opposing the General- issimo will take form in the very near future. In this re- gard considerable emphasis has been attached to the activi- ties of Marshal Li Chi-shen in Hong Kong, who was reported to have stated that he will form a provisional government in China proper imminently. It is difficult to credit Marshal Li Chi-shen with sufficient influence or capability of form- ing an effective provisional Government at this time.' Al- though it is evident that the 'personal position of the Gen- eralissimo is being severely contested at this time, and that 0 factors of potential dissidence are present in the govern.ment, it is at the same time recognized that the elements of mill- tary and financial power, which represent political power, still reimain at this time in the hands of the Generalissimo. g. Under the provisions of the China Aid Act of 1948, China will receive aid in the amount of $400,000,000 from the United States, $275,000,000 in economic assistance and $125,000,000, presumably, for military supplies. However, there is doubt that this program will bring about any real or permanent improvement in the situation. It may, however, serve to postpone total disintegration of the Government by improving the economic situation in the large city areas, NSC 22 - 5 - TOP-SECRET
and provide a training and equipping program for much needed troop replacements. h. The growing military and political power of the Chi: nese Communists is making a substantial contribution to the attainment of Soviet objectives in the Far East. These ap- pear to be: (I) Formation. of a Soviet-dominated puppet State in Manchuria; (2) A more circumspect, but equally positive program in China, based iipon the anticipated collapse of the Na-. tional Government. i. The situation in China will continue to be serious, but in the absence of the wholesale Nationalist desertions to the Communists:"" and uncoitrollable strikes and food riots in the.cities, it is believed that the Nationalists retain sufficient capability to forestall collapse in the immediate future. This capability, however, appears to be limited to a short period of time (say 3 to 6 months) unless certain - * military or economic improvements can be effected: i. In light of the existing situation, the following critical questions face the U. S. Government: (i) What will be the effect on the security of the United States should the present Chinese National Govern- ment collapse? NSC 22 6 - -TOP-SECRET- I.
(2) What should be the attitude of the U. S. tovard forestalling collapse of the present Chinese National Government? (3) What should be the attitude of the U. S. with respect to recognizing and/or aiding regional govern- ments in China, should this transpire? 3. The following courses of action would appear to be open to the U. S. a. U. S. aid might . be increased to the maximum extent feasible. This course of action would undoubtedly commit the resources of the United States to an extent which could be ill afforded at resent, particularly in the light of the ERP. It is also questionable, owing to the rapid deteriora- tion of the military and -ecnomic situation, as to whether commensurate benefits would ensue. J bi U. S. aid might be withdrawn. Such a course of ac- tion would undoubtedly precipitate the fall of the National Government and accelerate the financial and economic deteri- 6ration now in process. This step would appear to nullify the will of the Congress which has legislated aid to China to the amount of $400,000,000 foi- the current year. c. Continuation of U. S. aid on basis of Drograms now authorized. This course of action would recognize the in- terest of Congress in continuing the ECA aid program as well .SG 22 - TOP SECRET * * .. . . . . . . . . . . . - . -.v* I
/V as maintain, before the world, the semblance of adhering to announced U. S. policy toward China. Such a course could not produce the favorable decision required in the short time available to the Chinese National Government; nevertheless, it would be in the nature of "buying time" until the over- all world situation is clarified. d. United States recognition and aid might be shifted from the National Governnent of China to appropriate regional regmes that may arise as a result of the collapse of the present national government. Under this course decision would have to be made as to whether to affiliate with cer- tain separatist movements or remain aloof until such time 0. * as they might of their own accord arise out of the collapse of the present government. The process of encouraging sepa- ratist movements would be contrary to the expressed poligy of the U. S.. NSC 22 -8- -TOP SECRET . . ... ... . - .-. - . ....*... . .. ... .. . .... ..... . ."...r.
