This integration, earlier recommended by both the Commanding General, III Marine Amphibious Force, and Ccmmanding General, Republic of Vietnam Army I Corps, will equalize wage scales and working conditions for pacifica- tion elements, and permit centralized control of these elements for the first time. (S) In I Corps the RCC are being used in the Ngu Hanh Son pacifica- tion campaign in 5 villages with 21 hamlets, 5 to 15 kilometers south of the Da Nang air base. This area has until recently been dominated by the Viet Cong shadow government and guerrillas, although Viet Gong main force elements were cleared from the area in September 1965 by the III Marine Amphibious Forces. The Ngu Hanh Son campaign is progressing well and the new Saigon instructions should materially assist the operation. )%wngraded at i Year Intervals; Declassified After 12 Years. 1),,Dir. 520). 10 DoD 23 Feb 1966 CO?y L13J LIBRAR Y 'I SECRET
