[Guided missiles] Cruise Missile Programs (U) [the two separate Air Force and Navy programs should be consolidated for program efficiency; the B-52 matched missile is to enter full-scale engineering development, as are the land-attack TOMAHAWK variants; the ground-launch variant for a theater nuclear role will enter full-scale engineering development in FY 1979].

C. 20301 14 JAN 1977 1-MORAINDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY .CHAIR2.LN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF DIRECTOR, DEFENSE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING SUBJECT: .ruise Missile Programs (U) * (U) As a result of the DSARC II review, the Air Force and the Navy are to be cozmended for the accomplishments to date of their respective cruise missile development programs of ALCM and TOMA-AWK. (U) A major issue before the DSARC was whether or not an air-lau=ched cruise missile with a unique airframe should be allowed to proceed. In spite of the acquisition cost savings -hich wou'd accrue from such a course of action, I have decided that a con=on airframe for. all applications may impose unnecessary and unwarranted performance comromises on both weapo' systems. However, considerable benefits stil can be realized in joint test and evaluation, in quantity buy of common co=,oneT,ts, and in management efficiency, by conso7id:;t"e t-wo senarate Air Force and Navy programs, now independtntly managed by different program offices. ( (C) I, therefore, direct you to pursue with all vigor the cruise missile prcgrams as follows. a. (U) A Joint Service Cruise Missile Program Office (JSC,.PO) is to be established with the Navy designated as the lead service and Captain Walter Locke as its imediate 44..raim lranager. b. (U) The JSC.'.PO, under the general direction of DDR&E, is to develop the ALCM and the TO .IAWK cruise =issile weapon systems for the Air Force and for the Navy. c. (U) The first tasks of JSCiPO are to complete the PTE, leading to production decisions at DSARC III, of the ALC24 for strategic bombers and the TOMu.TAHAW"K variants includ- ing the imoortant Air Force ground-launched cruise missile application. Funding of these tasks is to be consolidated from the apnrcved program elements P. B. 64361F, P. 5. 63362F, P. E. 6336!N, and P. 5. 64367N. ODDR&E (S&SS/OSJ.. - . - . o ,' . .'. : . a.. . ..

(C) The Navy and Air Force are to submit jointly within 45 days from this date for DDR&E aonroval, the plan for establishin zhe JSCXPO and a set of program plans, schedules and zlestones for the resoective ALC'-M, TOy.WC and the Ground Laun.h Cruise Missile (GLC:.), reflecting the following specific auidelines. A revised Air Force cost estimate for -he 1LCM program based on evaluation of con- tract0r prcosals is to be submitted at the same time. (1) (C) The with a range of at least is to ent-er its full-scale Engineering Development for tHhe B-52 appi-iazion and to achieve an ION on or before and is to be given priority over the The B52 weapon system should be optimized for long-r nge c-ru1 missile carriace w:th consideration of both internal and extern.al carria-ae. (2' (C) The land-att:.6,ack TOMMIA?;M variants, with a rance of at ..astfor submarine Iaun=n and for Sura.ce s-4 aun-h, are to enter full scale Engineering Develc=-,e.n. (3) (C) The Air Force GLC. is to be adapted from the land-att z; a ZOA?A..K for mobile launchers, camable of a rance of at least or the theater nuclear role with ani IOC. Funds should be renrogra=med as required in FY78 so as to permit the t-LC . to enter full scale engineering development in FY79. (4) (U) Shi-- and submarine-launched anti-ship ....,.K is to enterful-scale Engineering Develoment. Shiop-lau h_o "'_A?EA: ,is to be cazable o: a-k0= a-;,on in all coma=tant shis inouding -r=ates, and such smaller plafrm s aS max ze z - ttaciv e to enhance Naval strike capab i.t. I Navy_ is to pursue aggressively the pevelc- ment of the necessary over--ne-hcrizon target acquisition, identification, and damace assessm.ent canability to be demonstrated by DSARC i7- of the anti-shi TO.LÂ£A, missile. ,(5) (U) The JCSP?O is to exmlore the development o: the ground-launched anti-shi- version of GLCM.
f. (U) An essential element in consolidation benefits is in joint tcstin. A joint test and evaluation master pan (T.?) is to be sub.itted for DDTE review within 90 days frcr this date. This TEM.? is to include realist.c miassile empo)r.e- test and penetrativity evaluation. (U) In a,.'tion, the JCS is directed to submit to OSD, within 9 days "-r- this date, a position paper resolving potential Servic rolcs/missicns issues for the case-s of: (1) grund-!auz--o nuclear deep-strike in the theater (Army and Air Force) and (2) ground-launched anti-ship (Army and Navy) and a second. paper enumerating cruise missile and associated. we-:on system requirements for the B-52 fleet, the SS-''s anC z.' e- combatant ships, and the GLCM missions both la-- at. ..%d and anti-ship. (U) The -Air Forze and the Navy are to initiate R&D programs in adva4c c ' missile technology and concept explora- tions. 4uch programs should involve wide industrial partici- vation in orer to introduce innovations and are to include but a.. not '.iied to terminal guidance, advanced propulsion :for SU_L's_n4 Cas. maneuver, compact low-power ECM, and ...-. .-- .
